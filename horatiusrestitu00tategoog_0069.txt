l S. vt. 71-76. Caura fuit pater hist qui macro pauper agello
Noluit in flavi ludum me mittem magni

Horace at the timeof their migration, 1 think, could hardly
be less than tweloe years old. That age will agree well
enough with the term, milri parvo, which chronicles the

stripes of Orbilius (2 E. 1. 70.); and an earlier dato‚1fear‚
will hardly allow sufficient age for many points of observ-
ation on life and manners, piclred up by the boy Horace be-
fore quitting the neighbourhood of Venusia. 1 speak ad-
visedly‚ when I say, that there appears no proof or vestigo
of his ever having lived in that country again: a hasty
visit, perhaps, in some year soon aller the battle of Philippi,
to settle old accounts, aud to see once more the friends of
his youth, seerna the only feasible supposition which his own
history of his life and writings will possibly admit.

On this presumption, too, we gain the opportunity for
Horace to have witnessed the manly constancy of Ofellus
under his adverse fortune,

2S. 11. 111. -- videas metato in agello
Cum peoora et gnatis fortem mercede colonum,
Non ogo, narrantem .....

and to have derived from Ofellus's conversation at that
tirne the materiale of his admirable satire, Quae virtus et
quanta, honi, sit vivere parvo, &a (2 S. ιι).

In his hoyhood it appears that ho had lnrown that para-
gon of au honest man,

2 S. ιι. lta Quo tnagis his tredan puer hunc ego parvus Ofellum
integris opibus novi non latius usum,
Quam nunc accisis, dte-to v. 130.

Let us now sce what other remarks had occurred tobis
