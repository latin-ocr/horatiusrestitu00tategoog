“Diis patriis Italoque coelo,” to the great deiight ol hia
friend Horace. That Ode, Ο sepe mecum, which aiter so
many years of long separation records the joyiul hour oi
’ their meeting again, is imbued with all the spirit oi the
kind-hearted man and the convivial hard. As an authentic
record also (in part) of Horace's own history, it is invaluable;
raulring indeed with those principal sources of authentic in-
telligente, Nemo ad me redeo.. .1 S. vr. 45—131. and Ro-
me aalma.. .2 E. 11. 41-52.

With a verse in that Epistle it may be worth the while
to compare two lines of the Ode, as no bad example oi Ho-
race trecked in his own snow.

Unda fretis tulit actaeae.

third of those passages.

Scandunt eodem, quo dominus: neque

Post equitem sedet otto Cura.

‘Phough in less interesting parallels, the Scholar with Ho-
race's writings iu true successiou placed before him, may de-
rive some amusement from tracing in different stages the re-
markable similitude of sentiment: the following instances
may deserve attention.
