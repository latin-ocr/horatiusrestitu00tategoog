Poemolum suorum Libros scripsit, constitutione: end to the
system leid dovn by Dr. Bentley, he is on four different
hendo decidedly opposed.

Bentley is vmng, he alleges, in mertingss.) thet Honce
st one ond the seme time devoted hisoen only to one speeies
of composition, and (2.) thot Horace did not give puhlict-
tion to separate pieoes‚ but only to whole books stt time.

Bentley is vrong nlso in merting (3.), thet Horace pnh-
lished the books sepsrntely one by one, end not more than
one together.

Bentley is further vrong in determining (4.) the yart
within vhich the severol volumes vvere composed.

Under the first of these hends, let me he ulloved to shov
t specimen of Kirchner's proposed mengement

In the year n. c. 28 and of Hortoe ³7· Kirchnerfixethis
dote for the following pieoes, for instance, mongst other,
2 S. ι. Sunt quihus in Sotira-..1 C. mr. Quid dodico·
lom... tc. xv. Jampaocaaratro... tnd3C. vt. Dalm
mojorem. . ..

It is on the suggestions ol' o nudem end etprim'ons inge-
nuity‚ thot Kirchner‚ lilre o new Sonndon, hes perpetrsted
this strange divulsion of vholes from soboles, nnd o conjunc·
tion ns strange ofpieoes vith pisces tied obtorto collo together.
The very sight of his Tabula Chronohryt‘eo Horatiano is
quite enough to ostonish nnd offend hy the presumption vith
which every single piene hno its seperate year precisely
offixed to it, and by the boldness vith which tll the pisces
nre dissevered from that connection within the mme bools,
which had remained undisturhed for serenteen eonturies.

Luclrily‚ on the one hund, interntl evidence, derived from

comparing the Alcnic metre in different books, effords on
argument which cannot vell be elnded: ond ns if to stnmble
st thot bloch, Kirchner does not hesitnte to declsre, thot sll
the Odeo of the first, second, and third boolrs vere promis·
cuonsly vritten end then puhlished collectively ot once inne.
