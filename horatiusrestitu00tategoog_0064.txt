Let thus much then suffice to show the clear and indisputable
connexion betwixt the localities ol Horace‘and the right
understanding of many other most important points in his
writings or in his character.

LlFEA AND §CHARACTER

Ἀ sannen of the principal facts and circumstances in
'the early life of Horace, especially where that tende to
'illustrate the formation of his characteres afterwards seen iu
his writings‚'shall next be attempted.

The father of Horace, aller having gained his 'freedom
in the¹ family from which that distinguished name was
derived to his son, was doubtless for many years afterwards
in the laborious and profitable office (l S. v1. 86.) ofa
Coacta at sales by auction3 and had gathered togethera

. 'considerable property by success in that employment.
· At this period of the Roman Commonwealth‚ the condi·
'tion of the Libertini was fast rising to that importance on
account of its wealth, which afterwards excited so much
indignation in the Ingenui, whose poverty was embittered
hy their pride: an indignation‚ be it ohserved, neither
merited nor reasonable. Whoever now reads in Toup

‚ (Offices. L. ι. C. 42.) Jam de artr'ficiis et quaestibusque
liberales habendi, qui sordidi sint, de, will in< a moment
diseern, that so many lucrative and not necessarily dis·
graceftd einplnyments, given up entirely to men of servile
origin, must have lowered and lessened the class of old ,
citizens without raising a class of new to occupy their ranls
and their influence in the state: the vacuum in fact vas
very imperfeetly and very unhappily filled up.
