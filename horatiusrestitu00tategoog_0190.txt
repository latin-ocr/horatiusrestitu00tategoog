on rna uersas or nonnos. (163)

The scansion of the trimeter (l) runs thus, in all its ad-

missible feet, some of them very rarely admitted.

To the exclusiou of the anapest in 5³⁰ from the table
here given (a foot so frequent in the Senarii of Seneca)
there are but three instances of apparent objection, which
when examined disappear.

Ep. ιι. 35. Pavidumqua leporem et advenam liquto gruem,

(which is a very rare instance of a line otherwise irregular.)
Read laqueo in two syllables, as alveo,

30. vn. 28. Tusoo denatat alveo.

These two peculiarities,

Ep. v. 79. Priusque ooelunr sidet instrlus mari.

- ιι. 23. Nune gloriantis quamlibet mttlleroulam.

turning similarly on the vowels, may safely be placed on the ·

same footing with Virgil's Geo. 11. 482.
fluviorum rex Eridanus... .-

and as that is pronounced Fluvyorum in three syllables, we
need not scruple surely so to pronounce inseryus and mul·
yeroulam likewise. '

The structure of the trimeter requires a caesura, or divi-
sion of words, after the penthemimer usually.

υ· υ· υ ΙΙημ- ν- νῦ

Ep. ιι. l. Beatus illel! qui procul negotiis...

or after the hepthemimer sometimes,

. . a Η . s. e-
lbid. 19. Ut gaudet insitivsll decerpens pyra.

And here comes in the curious question of accentual ca
ome.
