cnaouoroor or woars. (15)

Lct us now proceed to exemplify bya few striking in-
stances what absurdity is involved in the common ordesos
the books of Horace being taken for the true one, and what
immediate congruity on the other hand arises from observing
the ⁵arrangement of Bentley.

(1.) Horace in the rvth Satire of his lethech, vw. 39-
55. shows a great anxiety to disclsim all pretence to the
higher character os a poet: and well he might, without any
moclr modesty, disawow it. At that early periodos his life
and writings, he had nothing to ground the claim upon, ex·
cept the limited publication of a few satires, and tlte further
promise of talent in that particular vein.

But hear what M. Dacier says, as reported by Dr.
Francis.

“bd Erpa Ι Non satis est parus verm psrmsibere verbis.

M. Dscier thinks, that Horacewould not have been so
modest with regsrd to his Satires, and so fearl'ul os prosti-

tuting the name of poet, if he had not secured his own right
to it by his 0des.”

Hesr next M. Sanadon. (Vol. 11. p. 169.)

“39. Primum epo me iduum, dala-isa quibas esse poetis
Escae-pm numeru

Horace s'etoit ddja amure par scs odes le nom de Poete,
ainsi il ne risque riensi sc degrader pour ses satires.
Sa modestie n'en est que plus grande, et cette vertu ne
aauroit dtre petite dans un poete, pourvit qu'elle soit bien
sincere.” No exposure can make blunders lilre these more
ridiculous: they cannot be aggravated by any comment.
Pers Herdonia, on' the contrary, (Vid. Knorzn Lectiones
Venusinae, pp. 15, 39, 40. 1770) who amongst many
psradoxes maintained this, Horatii Poetae attic superesse
genuinum, proeter Epistulas et Sermones, drawa a very
different conclusion out of the verses before us.
