thst would demand a volume for itself. But in the chro-
nological table subjoined to these pages, it is hoped that
any historical knowledge directly required for the illustra·
tion of Horace, whenever clear intelligence can be had,
will seldom be found wanting.

In the meanwhile, however, with a more critical view
to the Tempora Horatiana of Bentley, it will bc exceed-
ingly necessary to heep in mind, that the years which
he has determined for the composition of the several books
of Horace, in his own nahed statement are liable to many
euvils, against which he has left neither caution nor de-
fence. He should have told us, for instance, that in drawing
up that calculation he kept his eye principally or entirely
on internal marks ofpallic history, while to dates connected,
with the life or death of individuale, however distinguished,
he (apparently) paid little regard, and in short that all
which he engaged to do, was to fix the earliest and latest
allusion of an historical kind which could be discovered
in the book of Horace then before him. All this (butno
more than this) he executed well and faithfnlly. Let ns
understand, therefore, what his intention exactly was: it
was a negative rather than a positive determination in the
dates which he ascertained.

Thus when he leaves an interval of three years betwixt
xxvur for the first book of Satires and xxxr for the second ,-
he never could intend to say, that during those three years
Horace's pen lay entirely idle: he meant (aad hc could
mean nothing else) that the very lalesl historical intimation
which he had been able to discover in the first book, did not
fall lower down than xxvru of Horace’s age, and that the
very earliest intimation of any public event contained in
the second book did not rise higher than xxxr of that cal·
calama.

With this important qualification constantly attached to
all the intervals apparent in Bentley's Tempora Horatia-aa,
