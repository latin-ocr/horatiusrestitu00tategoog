It nill be necessary, however, to promise, that Bentley'a
yeara of the life ot' Horace, here printed in Roman figures,
vere by him calculated in apeculiar way. Thus the year
of Horaoe'a nativity‚ a. c. 65. though he naa born in the
laet month of it, in Bentley's rechoning atanda aa the year
rof his age, the year aiher it as 11‚and ao on to the end of
Horaoe'a lise.

Instead of taking the natal year, Mr. Clinton malrea
n. c. 64. the firat of his calculation, that is the current year
till completed in December.

In the following happy sheteh given by Horace of hia
character and pereonal history, (and ithae not been adduoed
before) hon ingenioualy doea he contrive to afford the
calculation oi his age, by giving the year a. o. 21. though
now poet, from ita commodioueneae for expreaaing in verra
aa well the period of hia orn life (44) aa the consular namen
belonging ιο it.
