And hence it comes, that whenewer an early hour in that·
age is mentioned, some imputation is conweyed also ol in-
dulgence and excess: for luxury in thc higher ranlm had,
for prolongation of convivial enjoyment, gradually carried
back the hour of dining towards the middle of the day.
Without pretending to traoe the origin and progress of
fashion in this respect, we may appeal toTully's authority
