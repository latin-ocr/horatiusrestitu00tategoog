but allowed to have that pronunciation, oonsilyum and prin·¹
cipyum, each in three syllables.

And here it may not be impertinent to remarlr, that in the
hexameters of Virgil the genitiwes, servitii, auxilii, leo,
though commodious to the verse, never appear3 while
Horace uses only the old forms, consili and imperi, 3 C. rw.

3. Let us now proceed to the subject of structure, in
some of its moro important points.

The place of the eaesura is accurately observcd, except in
the following extraordinary cases,

1 C.xxxv11. 14. Montemque lympbl Ι tem Marebtiw

t 0. ιιν, 17. Speotindus lu oert Ι amine Mirtio. . .

the latter of which from the distribution of the accente is
far less faulty than the former.

Of the three instances which follow, the caesura may per·
haps be saved by the emphatic preposition of the eompound
verb in the second, but hardly so in the other two, although ⁴
reliewed perhaps by the elision.

l 0. xvr. 21. Hostile aratrum exereitus insolens. . .
l 0. xxxwrr. 5. Antehac nefas del promere Ceeubum . . .

20. xvii. 21. Utrumque nostrum incredibili modo . . .

Not one of the three peculiaritics is repeated in the latter
bools.

4. The consideration of ocoewtual codenoe here returns
upon us. That codence usually requires the leading accent
to fall on the fourth syllable, as,

l 0. 11. m Dissolve frigus .. Larga reponent. ..

or in entire words like the following, as,

30. r. 25, 6. Desiderintem . . . Tumultuosum. . .
