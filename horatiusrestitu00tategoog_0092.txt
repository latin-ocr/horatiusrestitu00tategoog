of the Sabine estate, we find him forming grand resolutione

aS. 111. 9. Atqui vultus erat multa et praeclara minantia.

He had this year retired on the Saturnalia (v. 5) into the
country for leisure and for warmth.

v. lo. Si uacuam tepido oepiaset villula teoto.

The latter charm we know the country possessed.

l'E. x. 15. Est ubi plus tepeant hyemes!

If it be aslsed what were the causes of that advantage, the

command of a sauny position on the one hand, and the

Horace (who reporta himself [l Ε. xx. 24] solibus optem)

the seacoau.
Thus in that fine Epistle to Maecenas, 1 E. νη. 10-13.

Ad mara descendet vates tuus, et sibl pareat,
Conmaotusque legata te, dulciamina, revisat
Cum Zephyris, sipoonoades, et hirundine primi.
Incidentally ue gether from another Epistle, that to
Scaeva, (xvrr. 52, 3‚) that Brundusium and Surrentum also
