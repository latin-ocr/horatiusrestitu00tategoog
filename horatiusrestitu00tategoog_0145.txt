the two last, and that alone, the dread of popular insurrec-
tion, ia specifically developed.
ln the passage which it is our object here to elucidate,

there are three different charactera proposed who are not to
be tempted from their respective attachments, the proud
candidate for public honours, the already rich importet at
horne of corn from Libya, and the contented yeoman

Paterna rura bobus exeroens ruis.

The splendid prize of temptation offered to each ia wealth
“ beyond the dreams of avarice,” but only to be won by his
becoming a neoto, i. e. the adventuroua mereator on the
dangerous main. And here evidently enough, abhorrence
at that offer, clogged with such a condition, would rnost na-
turally striks the third character described, being hardly
attributablc in the same degree to either of the preceding
parties, since, to gain ulterior ends of ambition or opulence‚
even they might possibly bc allurcd by ao magnificent a
prospect.

When the passage is once placed in this clear and satisfac·
tory light, it seems quite wonderful how the true interpreta-
tion, which turus on Gaudentem, (aa old at least as the time
of Glareanus) could ever have beon so strangely missed, and
modes to evade it, by otherwise interpreting the earlier part
of the Ode, with such perverse ingenuity deviecd.

tl. The true reading at v. 29. of Tu doctorum . .. on ne-
cessity arising from internal evidence, against uu and the
MSS, after the assent of scholare generally given, may now
talre its placeas it were by acclamation. The following brief
hints in favour of it, being partly novel also, may not be
unaeoeptable.

l. To the interrogation of J. dones, who edited Horace
in 1736. “ Si jam Diis mistos esset ruperia Horatius, cur
se Maecenatis suffragio cohonestari cuperet ?'' nothing lilre a
sufficient answer ever has been or can be given.
