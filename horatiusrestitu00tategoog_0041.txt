acts ignorantly on this behalf, but he acts grossly wrong
also: for tbose Odes marked with the faulty structure be ‚
has scattered promiscuously over the later bools in bis
arrangement and over the earlier, very much aliie. No
difference is lrnown3 no discrimination is preserved. Need
one say more? And here with these proofs of his jadg-
ment disabled, let us talre our leave of lllr. Sanadon for

the present.

The strange and accumulated mistaltes in which tbe
personal history of Horace has been long involved, it would
be au irlrsome taslr to discuss one by one in detail. Tbe
most important of them, however, shall be duly noticed in
the course of these pages; and tbe whole mass will be put
into a way for ultimate clearance. lt may be too much to
assert that the publication of tlre bools of Horace in the
original series of succession will at once set all other things
right: yet there can be no doubt, but the wrong, unnatural‚
confused order, in which his worls have hitherto been ex·
hihited, has given risc to a great portion of all the errors
existing at this day. And so long as tbe common arrange-
ment shall continue to influence the train of thought by the
order of penual, it will be difficult if not impossible to over-
come that proueness to salse combinatione, which the work-
ing on a distorted view must of necessity create.

But when once that disorder is banisbed and the natural
succession restored, theu tbe mind, insteadof being misguided
by the mechanical progress of the hand aad the eye, will be
by that progresa directed and sustained all along in traciug
the personal and poetical history of Horace. All tbe stages
of bis career will then develope themselves iu beautiful
nansition: especially, the Parian lamhics of tbe Sabine

Poet will precede aa they ought, the Sapphic and Alcaic
stanzas of tlre Lyrist of 'Firoli
