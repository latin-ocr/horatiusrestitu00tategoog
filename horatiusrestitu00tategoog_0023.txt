those tvo Letters of advice with such mastcrly-sltill and
such beautiful execution.

Before concluding, it is incumbent on me to aeknovledge,
with many thanlcs, the valuable assistance which 1 received
in the summer of last year, when at Riehmond, from the
line taste and talent of Mr. William King, in very earefully
drawing up the principa} articles ol Appendix. Mr. King
is already known, 1 trust, from tlte just eompliments
paid to him as my coadjutor in editing the Analecta Ma·
jora Poetica of Professor Dalzel in18273 and he vell de-
serves to be ltnovn from his labour so judiciously bestowed
on the last edition ol Mitiord's History ol Greeee.

· Nor may the valuable services of Mn. Robert Baldvin
be allowed here to pass unselcnovledged. Without his
friendly assistance and judicious advice, these sheets could

never have been carried thmugh the press; under the
peculiar difficulty of so many MS. additions and corree-
tions to be incorporated nith the old text, and tbe diffi·
culty itself aggravated by that text being so singular a
compound of original matter blended with quotation.
