v. 34. Regumque pruris nac satelles Orci,

where the tribrach (νυν) in 2¹¹⁰, if that deserves notice,

gumque natis. .instead.

Marnnxrr. 3C.xrr. Ionieaminore(w--).

Miserarum est Ι nec amori Ι dare ludurn Ι neque dulci,

according to Dr. Bentley, (by whose critical erudition bere
also the reader tnay beneiit‚) consiste of four Stanaas, each of
ten fect, agreeably to the following scheme:

The caesura betwixt the several feet (as in vv. 5, 7, 8, 12>
is not strictly observed3 though by the above distribution
all awkwardness is avoided betwixt one line and another.

Cas. Sarbievius, adopting this metre in one of his com-
positione, 2 Lyric. xxviro, bas made tlte stanna consist of
two trimeters and one tetrameter 3 and violates the synaphen
or continuity of scansion betwixt linc arrd line, (vv. 5, 6, 9,
10,) which in Horace frorn lirst to last is observcd.
