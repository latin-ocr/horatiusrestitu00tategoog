The following from Horace,

l C.xxv1. 11. lldnc lesbio! sacrare plectro..

20. 111. 27. stra exitdro et nos in eternum...

not only differ in the words aod in the accentuation from
those of Buchanan, but are two forms of the verse in the
first and second books which in the third and fourth never
appear again: Horace has branded thern as illegitimate.

10. Nor may this verse, according to hia maturer taste
decieively shown, terminate with one quadrisyllabic or with
two dissyllabic words,

The form
l C. xxix. Pronos relabi 1 posse Ι rivos...

which occurs eight times in the first and second books, and
the form

20. xlx. m. Nodoooeroes Ι viperino..

which occure three times in those books, are both of them

repudiated entirely from the third and fonrth.

By parity of reason, a trisyllabic word with an enclitic, .
as que or oe, or other monosylloble, must be excluded aleo.
And on this peculiar atring (it is remarkcd in the Prcface
to the Mune Etonenseo) Sorbievius has erred, but in one

instance only.

And here let us observo, that the entire rejection by Ho-
race of any modes of structure in his later boohs which were
rare ewen in his earlier, must have qnite escapcd the notice
of grammariane. To their ignorance in teaching, therefore,
may partly be imputed the gross errors committed by mo-
dern Latin writers; who would hardly have gone so far
wrong in deliance of their great model, if they had been
rightly instrueted first of all, or if they had loohed up to Ho-
race aa their only legitimate exemplar afterwards. More
