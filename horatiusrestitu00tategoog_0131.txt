klefore we dismiss this description of Horace'r familiar
dty, which hes mrswoidebly run to e great length of ‹le-il,
two or three additional remarks moy suffice to conclude the
subject.

Α course of deily life like thot here delinented could
hetdly be supposed ιο glide along without considerable
rsrieties. One noch, end of frequent occurrence probably,is
prtunttd to us in the Sotire, lS. rx. Ibam sorte vio
eocrd. . . Horsce must hove teken thet welk into the city
tome two honre before the usual time thet he quitted his
morning touch: for when he end his tormentor hed gone es
fer ts tho Temple of Veste, the fourth pert of the dep then
hewing olepsed (w. 85. quarti jem perte diei Ι praecensuit
would he nine o'clock of our rcckoning3 which seems ιο
involve e different disposition of the forenoon eltogether.

Nor nro we ιο imagine thet Horace did not occesionolly
tulto his there ebroed in the morning dntics of common life.
The oſjtotom eedels’too in attending lescen (1 E. vn. 8.)
end the opollosoreneie in giving buil for efriend, hc. (ibid.)
were certainly not unknown to him. For the salutandi
plures (1 s.v1.101.) is what he deprecetes es one of the
troubles consequent on the supposition of uhigher perentege;
und the words, 2 S. vr. 27. quod mi obsit, clere certumque
locuto, ofler onswering in the court, to my own detri-
menl, perhaps, moy fairly ettest thet his good nature now
nnd then intengled him in the losses which proverbiully
belong to suretyship in ull eges of the world. Akind-
hesrtcd men like Horace, therefore, would understand very
well what it meent,

A. Ρ. w. tte. Spondere leri pro paupere . . .

nor could he to the supposed son of opulence heve put the
touching question,

2 S. 11· 1⁰³· Cur eget indignue quisquam, te diriter
