os nncnnns. (115)

Maecenas remained at his post in the city during the norst
month, that of August, and over it.

ln the former, Horace descants on the dangers to others

which he had not the strength or the courage to encounter
himself·

vv. 3-6. Si manirera vis sanum rectoque valentem
Quam mihi das egro, dahis aegrotare timorati,
Maecenas} veniam ς dnm tiens prima miorqoe
Designatorom decorat lictoribus atris.

in the latter, Horace when inviting Maecenas to Tmoli,
as wehave scen, (P. D. 79.) thus marks the sultriness of the
aeason, and the political anxieties which engaged him at

Rome.
vv. 17-20. Jam clarus otmlmm Andromede pater
Ostendit ignem ς jam Procyon furit,
Et steila vesani leonia,
Soie dia· referente siccos

vv. 25-28. Tu, civitatem quis decantantur,
Cnras3 et urbi solicitus times,
Quid Seres et regnata Cyro
Bactra parent Tanaisque diacon.

On a different occasion, (3 C. v111. Martiis coeieba..)
when Horace invites his noble friend to join him on the
calends of March in commemorating his deliverance from

that peril of the trec, after showing in the Stanzaa, vv.
17-24.

Mitte civita super urbe ouras. . ..

that hc had no cauae then for alarm in the aspect of foreign
affairs, the Poet concludes with exhorting him in hia aa·
official capacity, phociae, to enjoy a brief respite (must not
the passage be so interpreted i) from attention otherwise dne
to the interests of cliente and friends.

vv. 25-28. Negligena, ne qui populna laborat,
Paroa privatin nimium cavare:
Dona prasentia napo letus horae, et
Linque aaron
