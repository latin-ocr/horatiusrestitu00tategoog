(192) ou rur. murras or Horace.

The form which next in point of number demandsour
notice,

Β. υ-ι---ν--,ι
20. xv. 7. Spirgent Ι olivetis l od6rem,

ia entitled to similar varicties according to the worda which
compone it.
l C.xw11. tl. Villea Ι et Uatteae 1 eubintia

30. xxix. 15. Coe'nae ! aino aulae‘irl et dotro...

Somewhat inferior in number is the following form:

c. ι-ι

30. xxix. 7. Decllve leontemplerio Ι braum.

iu which the middle part, from its very constitution, might
be expected to conaist much less frequently of single worda
than of combinatione lilre those which follow.

1 C. xxxvrr. 11. Sperlre Ι fortunquue Ι ᾱύΙοί
30. tv. 27. Davdta l non extinxit Ι hrbor.

The form 0. seems to have been studiously sought and
preferred in the third and fourth boohs by Horace's more
cultivated ear, being actually found in them ten times oftener
than in the first and second. Verses of the form

1). ι----ι

are very few in number, aa the natural combinatione are
rare which produce it. Ouly one case appears of a word in
itaelfsufficiently long.
