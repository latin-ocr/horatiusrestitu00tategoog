1. Flettery of Aoum has never been imputed to
Heraee; in whose pruises of the warrior (l C.v1. Scribat&
Varie . . .) every compliment must he allowed to be per·
fectly fair. His high lame too and popularity‚ even before
the battle of Actium, and the splendid vorke of his AEdile-
ships, (mc-33) arc elsewhere (2 S. 111. 185, and 1 E. vr. 26.)
brielly touched upon. .

The former of those passages may justily an observatien
rising eut of the anachronism committed in it. The story.
ot Servius Oppidius (vv. 168-186) is told by Horace
(lecturing in the maslr of Stertinius) ae having occurred at
Canusium when he was a huy. At that time, to say
nothing of other persons-no Agrippa was shnown: but. the
plsylhl aberration of Horace's pen, both aa to place and to
date, only males the introduction ef Agrippa's name the
pleasanter on thet account: with theson, >already betraying

symptoms ol young ambition, the father expostulateshefore·
haud on the folly and-madness of it.

That Satire, on the other hand, 2 S. v. Hoc quoque, Ti-
resia . . has of course all its anachronism instantly seen, aa
is facetiously intended: and the anger of Ulysees⁹

vv. la, 19. Utne tegam spureo Dnmae latim Haud ita Troiae
hle gessi, certans semper mclimihus.. . . ..

has the more exquisite effect for the contrast ol such au
ancient hero with such a modern upoesrt!

2. The younger sitense, great nephew of the historiar,
ie known to the readers of Horace from that beautilirl Ode,
2 C. 11. Nullas argento . . . aud 1 agree nith Ernesti in his
Onomaste'eon, thet he must not bs conlounded with the
Sallustius. ,ἰνι libertinas insaniem. . of 1 S. 11. 48, 9,
apparently a much older man. What leads to the mention
of him in this place, is the similitude which Tacitus tells us
