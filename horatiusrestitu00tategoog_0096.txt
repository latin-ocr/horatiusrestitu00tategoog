Epode, Altero jam teritur... . which from similarity of
subject might be expected to stand in conjunction with thc

Both those Epodes, in any thing like allusion ιο the
leaders of the great political parties, are obscure now, from
the Poet'e studied delicacy at the time: as long aa any hope
remained of healing the breach, Horace was not the man to
aggravata the discord. But when matters had corne to an
open ruptore, in that Epode, 1. Ibis Liburnis.. .he tes-
tifies at once his personal devotednesa to Maecenas, and hia
earneat desire to accompany his Patron to the scene of ap·
proaching conflict: and in the rxth Epode, Quando re-
postam . . .on the first news of Caesar'a victory at Actium,
Horace naturally addresses Maecenas in a strain of the most
delighted gratulation, yet even then (v. 29) not naming
Antony, though he clearly alludes to him3 while the
disgraceful phenomenon of (Cleopatra's) gaure-curteio, in
a scene lilre that, is represented as moving the indignation
even of foreigners to forsalre such a leader;
