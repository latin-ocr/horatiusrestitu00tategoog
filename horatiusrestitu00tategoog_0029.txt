it struck my mind very loreibly‚ that such su edition would
be hailed by Scholars as an era in Horatian literature.

That design, however, still hung in suspense, and might
yet have been indefinitely delayed. But in the course of last
year, (isan) 1 was led to expect the appearance ol a Second
Part of the Fasti Hellenici, ke, by Mr. H. Fynes Clinton,
brought down to the death of Augustus: and that expecta-
tion inspired mc with a strong auxiety to learu what the
Master Chronologist had done, under the head of Rovnon
Autbors, towards fixing or correcting the calculations of
Bentley. My satisfaction of course was very great to find,
that all the principa} points which had been laid down one
hundred and twenty years ago for the foundation of that
arrangement, may nov be received as determined once for
all by thc very highest authority.

Mr. Clinton himself on being informed of my intention
gives me the kindest encouragenvent to persovere: he ap-
proves of my undertaking so useful a work as an edition
of the books of Horace, arranged in chronological order:
and he assigna as a reason for his approbation, that the
neglect ol that order has produced much perplexity to the
student not of Horace only, but of many other authors of
the Augustan age.

Under all these circumstances, 1 now am emboldened to
proceed in the task; and as the design in tbe first instance
is submitted to the judgyment ofscholars, which it candidly
invites, 1 shall at once lay before them as preliminary to all
other disquisition the following extract from Bentley's Prae-
satio. The title is copied from the formula adopted by
Gesner, who in his edition of Horace gives all this extract
except what stands as the first section of it: and the divi·
sion bere made of the whole into parts commodious for re-
ference, will on that account bc readily allowed.
