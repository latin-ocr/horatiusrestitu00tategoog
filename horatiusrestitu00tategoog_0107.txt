One more association shall serve toconnect the mention
of Maecenes ss Horace's friend with that of Tivoli: for tlie
very disputehle neme of Mecenos'e Vitta in that ploce may
well be discsrded¹. The want of direct evidence for it and
still more its incompatibility with the total silence oi Ho-
rsce, justify to my mind the rejection of such an idea with·
out scruple and without the formality of an argument.

But for Augustus an unquestionahle title may be set up,
not only as sn admirer of the spot, but es an occasional
resident there, most probably, however, in the later years of
his life. Tivoli, it is well lrnown, was sacred to Hercules.
Now amongst the favourite retirements of that Emperor,
Suetonius, C. 72. reclrons the proximo urbi oppido, Mnu-
ot'um, Proeneste, Tibur: in the last mentioned of these
towns, in porticibus Herculis templi persaepe jus dixit.
Behold then the very scene, to which Maecenss's attention
was called, when Horace thought of appealing to the case
of aretired veteran most lilre his own. ’

l B. 1. 2-6. Spectatum satis, et donatum jum rude quaerls,
Mnoenos, iterum antiquo me includere ludo.
Non eadem est setas, non mens. Vejenius armis
Hermaia od postem lixis, lutet abditus apro,
Ne populum extremi toties exoret areni.

When Horace himself at Tivoli wrote thus, he had Ve-
janius then sctually in retirement there before his eye.

And now it is high time to bring these extended remarks
to the promised conclusion, or at least to show good cause
for protraction if necessary.

A chronological table, then, of the principal incidente in
the esrlier part of Horace's life, with the years assigned by
