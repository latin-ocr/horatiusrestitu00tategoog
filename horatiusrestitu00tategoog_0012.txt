Irv the Dissertation here prefixed to this Book ol' Horatios
Restitutio, I am duly sensible, that the idea may ariae of
something irregular and desultory in the composition of is
Let me candidly own, that I should have been very happy
to meet the expectatiou of my readers with a performanoe
more regular and systematic, if the peculiarity of the sub-
ject had more readily allowed meso ιο do.

. According to my own impressione, first os all, that suh-
ject itself was so extensive at once aud full of variety, that
with alittle elegant diffusion, (which in its occasional use 1
am sar from disparaging,) the materiale of this Dissertation
might be expanded easily into a separate volume: and iu
the second place, from the very nature of some of the dis·
quisitione, necessarily dry, however ιο the purpose essential,
certain brealrs of a pleasantcr kind seemed desirable, to re·
lieve the formality of argument, if that might be donewith·
out the discursive itself becoming tedicus.

The straightforward plainness, however, os the grem
points to be proved, may serve, amidst so much detail, to
excuse the want of methodical regularity in the process.
That Horace published his collected writingsfrom timeto
time in such an order of succession andin no other, and that
his principal residcnces, after he became a professed Poet,
were three determinate places of abedo, neither more, nor ·
less3 these surely are questions, which (when aidcd by tho
Chronologicol Table here subjoined) will hardly alarm the

, mind of an intelligent reader with any apprehension of per-

plexity.
