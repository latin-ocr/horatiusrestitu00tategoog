tc. 11. 9. lasurei Ι donandus Ι Apollinari.

The relative position of its act-ema remains to be con-
sidered: and the cadence of the Sapphic is regulated in the
form Α, by being accented on the 6th syllable, oron the
4th and 8th.

Grandinis misit Pa'ter, et rubente
Dexteri sicres jaculitus moes .. .

ln the occasional varieties of form under B and C, the
accent is admitted on theeth and 7th, or on the 5th and
8th ε

Β. Mercuri, facunde, nepos Atlantis. · .

C. Continet majore Poeta plectro.

which modes of accentuation are compatible with a disylla-
bic beginning as well as with the trisyllabie just given.

B. Fervet, immensisque miit profundo. . .
C. laenisllithyia, tuere matres

With all this diversity of forms in the verse, under such
limitations as structure end accent so combined will permit,
modern writers os the Sapphic Ode have not been content;
or rather they have not been acquainted with it. Amongst in-
stances in abundance from the revival of letters to the pre-
sent day, the following out of the Mutae Elonensea may
serve for sufficient illustretion of scansion correct and struc-
ture violated.

Vol. 1. p. 211 r. 1. Pertinax 1 et luxurians juventa . ..

— p. 169. r. tt. Hortuli det Ι primitias apriei.

Verses lilre these admit of no defence even from the authority
of Catullus, who wrote the Sapphic stanna in all its Greek

freedom, as yet uncheclred by the severer genius of tlre
Latin: for even the following lines,

ιι. 6. 23. Seu Sacas Ι sugittiserosque Ι Parthos.
Ultimi flos Ι pretereunte} postquam . ..
