imputad to him elsewhere by Seneca, even with the worda
solutio ίυηίσίε, Ep. xx. 115. aud reecboed by Juvenal,
must have been rcalined, (postquam ittam (9»Μρὶίσί-
toa), in the acquiredt'oibles of hia later years only. .

Iu thia view of the whole matter, we· instantly discover
what the plausible ,error waa that mialed the commentator
Acron, catching up the generd hint from Seneca and Juve-

home, to set the Epistola od Prsowas de Arte Poetica iu
its true light, that hardly any room ia left to desiderate or
expect further elucidation of it now.

If, however, any further proof were wanted that the family
of the Piaos did cultivate poetical talant, aud with some dis-
