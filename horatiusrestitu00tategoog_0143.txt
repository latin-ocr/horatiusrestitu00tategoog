From the view taken of Maecenas on this broad scale, let us
turn to that Ode of dedication, hy which more than hy any
other tribute to his name he has hitherto been so well known
to the admirere oi Horace.

The Ode (l C. 1. Maecenas atocio..) has very much
laboured under one misinterpretation and one false lection
which may deservo the regard of the critical render.

Ι. ln the text of this edition, the lines which follow..
evehit od Deos, with a full stop aiter thoee words, stand
thus punctuated.

vv. 7-14. Hono si motffium turba Quiritium
Certat tergeminis tollere honorihuat
Illum, ai proprio condidit horreo
Quidquid de Libycis verritur areis ς
Gaudentem patrio findere sarculo
Agros, Attalicis conditionibus
Nunquam dimoveas, ut trabe Cyprii
Myrtoum pavidare nairta secet mare.

If the true sense, as received hy many editors, be deter-
mined by that punctuation, it may be askcd: how came the
passage ever to be interpreted otherwise? 1 feel no scruple
then in imputing to two distinct causes all the error into
which any oi the commentatore have been mieled: partly,
to their not being aware that Gaudentem. . .is justly ern·
ployed to designate a separate character, Him who deligito
(like Deciderantem quod satis est..3c.1.25, Him eolre
boanda hie desire by a competency; Fhlgentem imperio..
3C. xvi. 31. Him wlco laos the splendid gowornrnent, irc,
dte), and yet more, to the disregard of a great peculiarity
frequent enough in the best Greelr and Latin authors;
namely, that aiter two or more specific subjecte of thought
are expressed, they do not seclr, as modern nicety requires,
some such mode of concluding the sentence, aa may belong
in common to all the notione that precede, but boldly and
almost carelessly conclude it with what is strictly proper
to that subject only which eomes immediately last.
