several objections immediately disappear3 as others again
may be overcome by consideratione of a different kind.

1. And first of all, to talre a strong instance.

When the death of vtrytt is by Mr. Clinton assigned to
a. c. 19. an acute objector may ask; how, then, could an
Ode of invitation to Virgil (4 C. κη.) Jom οὲνιὲο comites,
dcc, possibly be written in any of the years u. c. 17, 15.
the very cancelli within which Bentley has fixed the com·
position ol' the fourth book of Odes? My ansver is this,
(and lllr. Clinton thinks it just and satisfactory,) that
Horace, after publishing the third bools of Odes in u. c.
23 or 22. had evidently imagined his lyric labours then
concluded: nor had he any design, apparently, till called
upon by Augustus several years after, ιο resume the taslr of
the lyre. But iu the interval which ensued, what should
hinder him when writinga playful and in some peculiar
touches (vv. 15, 25.) rather a lreen address to virgil, from
using once more the lyric stanna? Its insertion allervards
iu the foatrtlt bools of Odes vas all natural enough:
it would else never have been lrnown to exist. For the
old Scholiast tells us on the Ode (rw) Qualem missis-
tram, dcc. Haec est ecloga propter quam totus tic liber
compositas est. And Gesner's sensible remark who had no
hypothesis to serve, hasbeen already quoted: cam semel
placuisset aonam librum edere, ia eum conjectum esse
quidquid od manesceret.

2. The deust ol Quintilios Vertar Cremonensis, that in-
comparable critic and friend, that censor honestas,

, (A. P. dall Qas'atr'lr'odquid recitares, ᾀι.)

ιο whose integrity ol advice aud severity of taste thc two

great poets were so much indebterl, is lamented by Horace

iu a tone of the deepest feeling and regret‚ l C. xxiv. Ad

Virgilium, Qua dremne sit mador, lic. The year assigned

to that event by Hieronymus (F. H. p. 237.) is n. c. at.
