“For as Horace invites Maecenas from Rome to his
Tibur, it seems inconceivable that he should press him ιο
make haste, lest he should he always taking a view 01 Tibur.
How much properer would it hove been to recommeud his de·
partuve from Rome that he might enjoy the soenes 01 Tibur!

To agreat variety 01 disquisitione, more or less intelligent
audentertainingon this text and on the topics naturally
connected with it, the references below given ⁸ will direct the
reader3 if any of the books happen to be within his reach.
But here it may be as well ιο add, however, that the combin·
ation 01 temper with odom, so esseutial ιο the establish-

meut 01 the new reading, is heppily defended not only in ⁶

general by his own expression, (1.E.xv111,98‚) Nec te
semper-inops agitet vexetque cupido; but by the specific
authority 01 Ovid where he describes his natal-ia rura-Fasti

ιν, 686.

Parvo ted assiduis uvida semper aquis.

Having thus secured the complimeut due to an Etonion
and King's man for sterling the question so vitally important
ιο the Lyric hard 01 Tivoli, I shall not however procced on
credit talen for his emendation being true: 1 shall rather
appeal for corroboration 01 its truth to the internel evidence
which the lst, ed, end 3d books 01 Odes, the lst book 01
Epistles, and the 4th book of Odes in that order, all cou-
tribute ιο yield, not only of Horace's often visiting Tivoli,
but 01 his residing iu that quiet town very much and osten
during a great part 01 his latter days.
