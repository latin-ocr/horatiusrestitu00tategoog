In one word, then, what is the plain infercnoe from all
this? Phidyle (whether a real person or in part imaginary)
must be considered as a yeoman's wife in the neighbourhood
of Tivoli. Such a person we may nell suppose to have been
the pudica mulier (Ep. 11. 39.) elsewhere described; and,
innocense of character being therefore presumed, we have

¹ only to take immunia at the beginning of that fine stanna,

Immunisaranr......miea‚

in ita natural sense of costleaa, with little or no eost ; which
Casanbon (Persian. lmit. Horat. ad S. 11. 75.) and Bentley
(a'n loc.) agree in maintaining against the vulgar interpre-
tation of innocent, as unauthorined as it is nnnecessary.

But we have not yet done with this Ode. From Tivoli
or the high grounds near it, Phidyle might probably see
Algidum or Albo (vv. 9-11). In the Sabine valley, the
Villiea of Horace (if such a person there was) most assuredly
could see nothing of the hind; and was far too remote to
beor anything of places like those. There would have
been a violation of all nature and probability in addressing
auch an Ode, even nomine unua, to a person so circum-
atanced.

Theo too, (v. 16,) from whence was the myrtle to corne?
from the same genial soil which y'ielded the roae, the iay,
the opium, and the nine,· from the mite solatm Tiburis
(l C. xvrrr. 2.), to be sure.
