aa 1111111111 but faithful statement here given may serve to
exemplify.

M. Sanadon, in the Nouvelle Distribution, comprises his
first boch 01 Odes (made up 01 18 Odes and 2 Epodes)
within the 25th and 3lst years of Horace, a space of seven
years: Dr. Kirchn'er in his arrangement scatters those 20
pieoes over twenty-four years, that is, between the years
26 and 49 of Horace's life, placing 1110, and tvo only, 01
the whole number, within the limits assigned to them by M.
Sanadon.

Herc theu are tvo scholare by profession, evidently men
01 erudition and talant, labouring vith all diligence to illus·
trate dc noco the life and vritings of Horace. And vhat is
tbe result? At first setting out they so far agree as to
1111011 (101111 and forsalre the old landmarlrs 01 that division
into books, vhich from the earliest ogeis known to have
existed: and when, on returning from their respective dis-
0011τὶ11, the report of the German is contrasted vith that
01 the French adventurer, 110111 the first specimen 01 com-
parison, what else 111111 naturally led to conclude, but
that one 01 them cannot have gone right, most likely from
tbe chances 0111101 that they both have gone vrong?

Ῑ1, however, 11111 all, any person should 1111 inclined to
101111 on fuller examination his ovn judgment of their re·
- spective merits, the volumes 01 Sanadon 111 to be found in
tbe British Museum; and ’1 copy 01 the Quasrrorvss

1101111111 01 ’Κ111111111 is nov* placed there on purpose,
· that the vhole treatise, and particularly bis Tabula Claro·
magica Horatiana, or balance sheet, may be at any tim'e

impeeted.
