to the right year in the spring² of n. c. 38. will receive the

from Mr. Cramer's Description of Ancient Italy. The most
beautiful passage in that poem shows how rapid and deep
the groruh of affection had been betwixt Horace and his
two friends, Virgil and Varius: of Plotius we know little
but by name.
