No ear could confound the verse of Horace with thasos
Casimir.

'she Christian Post, Pneunsrrus, (circ. 400 aa.) hes
constructed asystem of his own out of the third, second,
end first (in that order) of these interposed Choriambics; for
which, in the nomenclature sometimes applied to Horace's
Odes, the narne would stand thus:

τρίκωλος episcpous,

denoting that there ere three kinds of verse, and then that
three lines form the strophe or stanza.

The following specimen is taken frotn the Prooernistm to
his Caerulea, and only by one blemish at v. 6. discovers
any incorrectness in the composition.

Per quinquennia jam decern,
Ni fallor, suimus: septimus insuper
Annum cardo rotat, dum fruimur sole volubili.
Instat terminus, et diem
Vicinum senio jam Deus applicat:
Quid nos utile ten Ι ti spatio temporis egimus ἲ
AEtas prima crepantibus
Flevit sub senilis: mox docuit toga
lnsecturn vitiis salse loqui, non sine erimine.

Let me take this opportunity, in the words of Dr. Herbert‚
to call the attention of scholars to the splendid passage at
the end of Prudentius eontra Symnroclmtn, concenring the
vestal virgins: it begins,

v. 1⁰69. Captiuis pudor ingratis addicitur aris,

end is inferior to nothing of the same kind in Juvenal.
