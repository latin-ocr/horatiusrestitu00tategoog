From this passage, Herdonia very ingenionsly and justly
concludes, Horatium se nullos odas scripsisse profiteri:
nothing in itself more true nr ruer rme. But the
good Father too hastily assumed, that the Odes if written
by Horace at all, had been written as their collocation to
him indicated, at some period prior to that of the Satires.
Herdonio would have been disarmed of at least one argu-
ment, perhaps in bis opinion a very strong one; if he
had ever viewed the books of Horace in the order of their
original publication.

(2.) If there be any truth in Bentley's calculatione, the
ad book of these Satires was collectivcly publishcd not later
than the year s. c. 32. If there be any faith in the F osli
Hellenas, the restoration of the Roman Eagles from
Parthia did not take place earlier than thc year u. c. 20.

Horace (2 S. 1. 10-15) when thus urged by his learned
friend Trebatius,

Aut ai tantus amor scribendi te rapit, nude
Caesaris invicti res dicere, mu ta laborum
l’raemia laturus.

declines the tasls‘ with much elegance and andrea, on the
ground of inability to describe the scenos of heroic warfare.

-- cupidum, pater optima, vires
Deficiunt ; nequa enim quivis horrentia pilis
Agmina, nec fracti pereuntes cuspide Gallos,
Aut labentis equo describat vulnera Parthi.

The Parthians and Gaulo, from having been the principal
objecta of dread to tho Roman armies, arethe natione
selected to furnish, each of them, a very tremendous image
of battlc; with a tacit reference perhaps to the exploits of
Marius at a distant period and of Ventidius ou a later
occasion, n. c. 39.
