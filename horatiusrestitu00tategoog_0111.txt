Now as Bentley's allowance of time for the first and second
books ol Odes runa down as low as n. c. 25. the disagree-
ment in thissolitary example might not be valid (or might
not‘be pleaded) against his chronology.

But it is far more candid and ingenuous at once to con-
fess, that where any difficulties, created by the details of
hioyrophy, depend on the authority of Hieronymus alone,
Ῑ am rather reluctant to submit; partly, because the author
of the Fasti Hellenici has himself in cases of that lrind de-
tected several inaccuracies; and partly on amore general
. ground of reasonable doubt. Mistahes in the dates of birth
or death, dac.¹ in a distant age, where pri-rote persons are
concemsd, may well *be expected and excused; because
without some public erent or other to rest upon, such dates
must often float loose as it were for want os anchorage.

3. A remarkable instance os error in the biographical
dates of Hieronymus, occurs in his account of Lucilius the
Post as born a. c. 148, and as dying in 103. With this
date of his birth, two well attested facts are grossly at va-
riancec the one on the authority os Velleius Paterculus,
11· 9, 4. “Celebre et Lucilii nomen fuit qui sub P. Africano
Numantino bello eques militaverat‚'' rac. 134. in which year
Lucilius, so dated, must hare been a boy under age3 and
the other, told by Horace of his personal friendship, when
already known as a bold Satiriat, with the younger Scipio,

,who died in a. c. 129.

- 2 S. ι. tta-74. — Quid? cum cat Lucilius ausus
Primus in hunc operis componere carmina morem,
Detrahere et pellem, nitidus qud quisque per ora
(lederet, introrsum turpise num labus, et qui
Duxit ab oppressi meritum Carthagine nomen,
Ingenio offensi? aut irasc doluere Metello,
Famoaiaque lupo cooperto versibus ἲ Atqui
Primores populi arripuit populumque tributim3
Scilicet uni aequus virtuti atque ejus amicis.
Quin uhi se a vulgo et accub in secreta remdrant
Virtus Scipiadas et uritis sapientia lacell3
