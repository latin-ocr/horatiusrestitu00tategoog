nu ruuaoura normania. (137)

my excuse be pleaded iu the paaaage recently quoted from
Pliny or iu that picture of the recitator acerbare with which
the Epistle to the Pisoa ia concluded.

Firat of all then, private recitatiou of the Poet to a sev
friends, aa we gathcr from 1 S. 1v. 73. or to Augustus, aa
some other Poeta did, 2 Ε. 1. 223, and 1 E. xix. 43,or toa
friendly critic like Quintilius, A. P. 438, raa practiaed by
Horace himself. And thus, young Piao (vv. 387, 8) ia ad·
vised to submit his compositione in the {irat matance to the
criticism of Maecius and hia father ond Horace.

Secondly, other Poeta did not scruple to recite their nic
inge at the common bath or even iu the Forum, (l S. rr.
74, 5), or to bribe a low audience lor a public recitation
l E. x11.37, 8).

'l'hirdly‚ some authors made intereat trith the masters of
schoola to get their poetry into daily uae by dictatiou; a
practice which Horace mentions with great diadaiu. (l S.
x. 74, 5. 1 E. xix. 39, 40.)

And laatly‚ then, aa Horace at an early period evidently
disliked to make his pieces lmowu hythe usual way of reci.
tation (l S. ιν. 23.), so on reaching the advanoed maturity
os authorahip, his pride lay in being read (l E. xix. 34) by
the respectable fetu and of course he tooli the higher mode
only of publishing by means of the boolaeller. 'l'hat Epiatle
(xx.) AdLibromauum, accordingly, will reward the peruaal:
it is full of amusing and curioua particulare.

Whatever honour hasbeen attached to the name of
Lonurua (tbeConsul of n. c. 21.) by that splendidOde‚ 4, rx.
Nesorte credar. . . . may well be received aa the tribute ol
siucerity aud truth from hie admiriug and devoted friend3
especially when the date of ita composition ia considered,
some 15 years before the time when Augustus entrusted
him with thc persoual care and military educatiou olbia
