Mr. Gifford, indeed, iu his presace to Persius, considers

the lives under the name of Suetonius as compilatione from
different Scholia of unequsl value. But allowing Suetonius
himself to have been thc author, yet even he lived aud wrote
afull century aster the death cf Horace. And to a spotia
Horace's own time evidently so little known and frequented
aa the vale of Digentia, (now called Licenza,) unless Sueto·

scorrer. The Life imputed to Suetonius seemed to lix the

neighbourhood. When therefore tho Acoocalo D. Domanico
