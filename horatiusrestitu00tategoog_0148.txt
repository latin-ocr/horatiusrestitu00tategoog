ΟΝ AUGUSTUS CAESAR AND THE SECOND
ODE, JAM SATIS TERRIS.

‘-

Tne notion of this well-known poem having been written
on account of the prodigies which followed the amassination
of Julius Caesar, it ia hardly necessary to refute; if it be
hut for s moment recollected‚ that Horace himself was st
Athens in that year (a. c. 44.) and in the following years
wne serving under Brutus, as tribuous militnm. The argu·
ment of Sanadom (following up a suggestion of Daeier‚)
who grounds it on facta recorded by Dio, seems to afford as
complete a satisfaction perhsps, as such a question in this
age can well admit.

That historian informs us, (L. nm. 16, 20.) that iu the
night of that day, tlte Ides of Jnnnnry, s. c. 27, on which
the high appellation of Augustos was conferred on Octa·
vianna Caesar, tlte 'l'iber swollcn (aller a thunderstorm pro-
bably enough) overflowed the lower parts of Rome with a
tremendons inundation. Whatever prognostic of Augus·
tns's future greatness might, if Dio reporta it might, be
formed hy soothsaycrs,1loracc appears to have been led
into a very different train of sombre reflection. He construes
that swful visitation into a divine call for new messnres to
expiate the accumulated guilt of so continued a civil war.
Scelus cepione (it is most justly remarlced hy Gesner)-
hic nonest punire interfectores Caesaris; hoc olim factum
erat, satisque parentatum illi sangnine tot hominum: scd
purgare n scelere, ab impietate bellorum civilium, rempub·
licam, et pace firmare atquc concordii. llaec res cum hu·
