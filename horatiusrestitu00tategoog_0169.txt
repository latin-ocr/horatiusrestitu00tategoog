On the other hand, with regard to the historica] facts
themselves and the years of their occurrence, Kirchner
may be generally right: it is not on that ground perhaps
that any serious objection can be brought against him. His
hastincss in every where assuming the identity of such an
allusion to a foreign name in Horace with such an event or
such a war at such a precise time, thia may be regarded as
the igniasuluue, by which he is perpetually led astray in
venturing to fix the date of each separate pieee.

Let one instance suffice to exemplify the nature of that
assertion here made: adetailed examination of the whole
would require a volume. Horace, in 3 C. xxrv. addresses

the Roman reader thus,
Intactis opulentior

Thesauris Arabum et divitis Indisa. ..
'Thereforc, says Kirchner, that Ode must have been
written before the year a. c. 24. in which AElius Gallus is
recorded to have ledan expedition into Arabia Felix. That

so that the trcasures of Arabia remained as erelire and urr-

does not scruple to hang his hypothesis of the new date nc.
