great change of age and character, which the Author had
undergoue in that interval betwixt the last dateofhis Satires
and the first of his Epiatles, the wonder is that any idea
should have occurred to aScholar lile Moaonusrnau of
writing alumni treatise De Sotirae atque Epmtolae Horo·
tiam discrimine (Lipsiae, 1801.); when perhaps, unless
from the Epistles immediately following the Satires aa
hitherto published, even he, aware as hc was of Bentley's Ι
arrangement, would hardly have thought either of contrast

To exemplify all thia by adducing the passages at full,
