(Hist. of Rom. Lit. Vol. ιιι. p. 232) “ is the great Pompey
orbis aon Sextus, long the chief enemy and rival oongostus‚
ever mentioned vith contumely or disrespeet.” The only
exception, perhaps, appears in the 1xth Epode, where Horace
refers to the convivial joy which a fev years before (uc. 36.)
he had shared vith Maecenas on the defeat and ssight of

excused, if the consideration of public affairs, as bearing on
Horace's character, be not here pursued any farther. We
