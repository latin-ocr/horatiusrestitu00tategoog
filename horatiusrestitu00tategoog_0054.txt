aad his neurada coene, paroc aab lare (3 C. xxrx. 14-16.),
were calculated to smooth the brow of the statesman Μω-
cenas. And to his romblings, when first aresidcnt at Thali,
with such delight antid that romantio scenery—

(—par luntre, amoenae 1
Quos et aquae subeunt et anrae. 3 C. rw. 7, 8.

we are clearly indebted for Horace's.assuming a poetical
character entirely new, in the transl tion to the Romam
fidicen lyra (4 C. 111. 23.) from the writer of Satires and
Epodea only. In one word, then, on his own express
authority, on that spot, and et that time, his lyric writings
had their actual commencemcnt.

Two out of the eight passages, here adduced, on which I
rcly sor the establishrnent of Horace as a sojourner at
Tiwoli, may in that view justify a more particular notice.

His invitation (No. 111.) to Septimius has been well illus·
trated by the late Mr. George Hardinge. (Nichols. Lite-
rary History. u. s. p. 732.)

“ Horace begins by telling him that he knows his friend
would accompany him to the remotest and wildest part of
the world:

Septimi, Gades aditure mentm, et
‘ comanam indoctum juga sarra nostra, et
Barbarus Syrtes, nbi Maura semper
AEstuat unda.

“Of course he should be equally desirous to accompany
his friend: but hc means to decline it, andhc is to give the
reason for it, which is, that he wishes for no Tarentum,
unless nnrvnn from Trana. The Ode in any other sense
would be unintelligible, and the wish for Tibur absurd,
especially with a reference to his old ape, which had not
then arrived,” &a &a ’

That Alcaic Stanza (No. ιν.) forms quite a locas olas-
sa'cus in the personal history of Horace.
