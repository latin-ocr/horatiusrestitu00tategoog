For such were his vous peculias places out of Rome, ol'
usual residence or occasional resort. The first was his

Sabine villa and estate in the vale of Licenaa; after Chnupy
and nomenno de Sanctia, described and verified (aa it
should have been sooner told) by Mr. Bronten, in the
“Sabine Farm,'' 1810. The second spot refreshed him by
