, verse (3) bas this scansion

The last syllable is always loug; and twicc only with
hiatus, in along vowel, l C. xxm. 3. 8. aniccty not much
obserwed by later writers of this Horatiae stanzu

Iu the verse (3) also, the just collocation of thc acecnts
may not bc neglected3 which Casimir, however, bas once
or twice disregarded.

For instance,

t hyric. xxvtu. 7. Raptimus, puerbrum . ..

is aecented in a way quite unknown to Horace: it bas the
very same cadence with tbc Ionica minore, 'l'cnerorum
puerorum, n different species of verse; and though witb the
satne qttatttity, is as uuliltc as can be imagined to (l C. v. 7.)
