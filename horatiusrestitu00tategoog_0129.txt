The lines next quoted from the Epistle serve incidentnlly
to show, that Horace for that year at least staid in the city
over the birthday of the Great Juliua3 then observed as a
diesseatua by cessation from business and affording oppor-
tunity in its eve for a longer night of cheerfulness than his
friend the lawyer could otherwise have enjoyed. The day
itself (F. H. nc. 100) fell on the leth ot⁴ Ju1y; quarto
Idus Quintiles: and on the preceding evening the aun
would set at Rome nearly at seven o'clocl( of our rechoning.
This particular may here deserve notice, if it be'only to
introduce one remarlr; that as the nsunal or solar day nith
them nas divided into tnelve hours (from the 1st to the
xrrth) of different length at different cersona, I may be ex-

The remaining lines of the Epiatle sufficiently exemplify
that charm of the mundae paupertatem, superadded to
the more essentisl teste in selecting a party of congenial
spirits; which to the humble triclinium of Horace, neat but
namon, (such the lecti of Archiua's making seem to have
been‚) mrrat have imparted a peculim attraction, beyond the

purchase oi luxury and opulence.
