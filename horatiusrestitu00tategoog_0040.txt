sensible mind a deep feeling of solemn grandem, varied by
amenity, and pathos, and fine imagination.

If therefore any juxta-position of Odes preserved in all
MSS. and editione, might command reverence from an editor
of Horace3 Odes like these sik could not possibly suffer
violation by being torn asunder. Sanadondisjoins these
six Alcaic Odes from one another entirely, and has not leil
even any two of them in any connection or contiguity
whatsoevcr!

(vid. Treatise on Metres, No. xrx.), that in the third line
of the Alcaic Stanza,

to consult his ear with acuter delicacy than before3 so that
he vigilantly ewerafter guarded the third line, the key·stone
of the Alcaic stanna, against modes uf structure, which his
improved sense of harmony condemned. Briefly to place
the matter in the strongest light, no other hypothesis will
account for the phenomerra.

In this nice predicament, what part does Sanadon plsy?
The truth is, that such exactness of metrical observationwas
:unknown in his time: and we most aequit him on the charge
of neglecting distinctions, not then brought into notice.
But for all that excuse, the main ground of conviction re·
mains the same. Sanadon, in his Nouoclle distribution,
