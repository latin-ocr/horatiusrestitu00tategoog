tribute of fame which a Poet of such talent might confer,
carries nith it every reasonable evidence oi' truth, aa to tbe
origin of tbe Poems alluded to.

Scripta quidem ejus usque adeo probavit, mansuraque
perpetuo opinatus est, ut uon modo Saeoulare carmen com-
ponendum injunxerit, sed et vindelicam victoriam Tibepi
Drusique privignorum auorum; eumque coegerit propter
boe, tribus Carminum Libris eo· longo interuallo quartum
addere.

Other consideratione too may here deserve our regard.
The very mixture of articles, in matter certainly beser, if
not in execution, compared witb so much magnificence in
the principa] Odes of the 1vtb boolr, is enough to indicate
something extraordinary. In tbe few vords of Gesner in·

tbe very nature and object of tbat great occasional poem, it
must have been separately publisbed in the year (a. c. 17)
assigned to the celebration of the Ludi Semelam,- whereas
of tbe fourth boolr of Odes, froin tbe peculiarity of its con-
stituent parts, there could be no collective publication till
some tvo or three years after tbat date.

Need I here bestow a moment's notice on the pomp and
conceit vitb vbioh, out of various lyric pieees of tbe Poet,
Sauadon, and aiier him Ancheraen, have arbitrarily con·
structed a dromo quoddam seculare of their own. J ustly,
yet mildly enough, is their audacious absurdity, in thus
