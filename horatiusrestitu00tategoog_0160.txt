The pormait of Agricola, known to every scholar, as drawn
at full length by the affectionate pencil of his souin-law,
may conclude the catalogus. The partial admiration, bow-
ewer, of Tacitus for that grem and good man, bas tempted
the biographer into an apparent sewemty of reflection on
persons not endowed with felicity of temperament lilre bis.

S. 42. Sciant quibua moris illicita mirari, posse ctiam snb
malis principibus magnos viros esse: obsequiumque ac
modestiam, si industria et wigor adsint, eo'landia excedere,

¹quo plerique per abrupta, sed in nullum reipublicae usum,
ambitiosis morte inclaruerunt.

And yet Agricola, we read, ewen if he died by a natural
death, was hardly permitted to end his days in peace. Nor
could Tacitus, when afterwards on the high road ol* his·
torical duty, deny the atamp of his'deepest praise to Paems
Thrasea and Barea Soranus, and to other noble spirita,
whose examples of fortitude and honesty, in the worstof
times, demonstrate that Cassius himself (Annal. rw. 84)
was not truly called the ultimus Romanorwn.

fashion in other respects, but pettily ostentatione of his
wealtb,''has been already noticed (App. ιιι. p. 114) in proof
of Maecenas’s sometimes going out to an early, that is, to a
fasbionable dinner. The name of tbe entertainer has
ufforded scope for the acuteuess and erudition of Buttmann
(u. a. p. 472.) in pursuing the conjecture of Lambinus.
that, to preserve some semblance of dclicsey, Horace undar
that grotesque name really intended to denote Sanwsnrnnus
Rufus, a person historically known from many writers who
have mentioned him.· · ’ ⁴ ’
