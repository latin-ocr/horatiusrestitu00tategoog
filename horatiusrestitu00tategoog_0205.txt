form of the Sapphic hore marked (Β) is very spuringly‚
some seven times in all, introduced. ln the third book,
though otherwise (it vill be seen) distinguished as sm era
in Horace's alteration of the Alcaic, not a single departure
from the form (Α) of the Sapphic lineis anywhere ad-
mitted3 while the form (C) has never yet appeared at all.
Pass to the Carmen Saeeulare and the fourth boolr; and you
find the form (C) for the first time introduced, with the
form (B) more largely than before, contributing to the im·
provement and variety of the stanes.

Under these circumstances, let us look to the Nouoelle
Distmbution (already alluded to, P. D. p. 13) derised by
M. Sanadon3 and see whether he bestows any notioe
either on the progessive stages, so well defined, by which
Horace carried that lyrical metre to its ultimate perihodon,
or on the temporary doubt, betrayed in his third bools,
whether he was right or not in admitting the first step of
variety. In the face of these striking facts then, as now to

us they must appear, demonstrating the separate entire-
ness of the third book from those before, and from the

fourth book with the Carmen Saeculare which followed, M.
Sanadon, on a fancied plan of his own, tears the whole

twenty-six Sapphic Odes (excepta few omitted) from all
Ἴ their ancient neighbourhood, and scatters thern ad libitum,
far arrd wide, over his nouvelle dotatmion Ι

After tracing with this exaetness the commencemeut, the
halt or retrograding‚ and the satisfactory close, of Horaee's
career in Sapphic versification, it remains brielly here to
show on what general ratio of the different modes of struc-
ture any composition in that metre should be formed, so as
best to coincide with the practical model of the Poet's own
mstme judgment. The Carmen Saeculare then, one of his
two longeut Odes· in that verse, may be fairly taken for the
purpose3 and with sufficient accuracy of proportior, it -pre-
sente the following result, to combine more or less, in every
