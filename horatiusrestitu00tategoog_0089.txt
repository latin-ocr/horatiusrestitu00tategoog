Assuming this origin of the Satirc to be correct, we may
accept as literally true, Horacc's own account of his begin-
ning to write werse; that hc was first driven to it by neces-
sity after the continentior of his paterna} estate ;

In all the books of Horace, indeed, those of Satires, of
Epodes, of Odes, and of Epistles, as the constituent parts
now stand arranged in each, 1 am strongly of opinion, that
aiter a due nllowancc for much caprice and casualty perhaps,
there may still be discovered great ingenuity shown by
Horace himself in the close succession by which some pieccs
are brought together, and not less of skill, judgment, and
delicacy in thc intentional disjunctior of others.

The peculiar consideration here suggested from internal
evidence, will support the whole hypothesis of Bentley by a

suffice for the present.

Thus the similarity of attachment which Horace bore to

to thinlr that the two persons might be identically the same,
and that of the two Epistles as they now stand, the latter
