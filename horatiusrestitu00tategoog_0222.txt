We have here to remark a singular change in the practice of
Horace. ,
The form (D) above described appears veryseldom in the

lst and ad books: in the 3d and ath it became so much a
favourite aa to appear nearly 10 times as often.

differs from the precedent only by its ending in one quadri-

syllable instead of two dissyllabic words3 and tlre few in-
stances of itare evenly dispersed over tlre four bools.

Here also the change in Horace's practice is singular, but in
the opposite direction to thot of D. The instancea, not
many in all, occur three times as ollen in the first two boolrs
as in the two latter: the form had apparently gone out of
favour with him.

Fand 9. F are forms similar enough to be classcd to-

gether.
