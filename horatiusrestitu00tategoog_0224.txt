POSTSCRIP'I' ΤΟ Tria METRES.

'rho boast of Horace,

³ G. xxx. 13, lt. Princeps AEolium esrmen sd Italos
Deduxisse modos. . . ·

that by happy change and adaptation he had transferred the
metres of Sappho and Aleaeus into the uses of Latin poetry,
might require for its full justification a more detailed comm
parison betwixt his Lyric verses and tho remaining frag-
ments of those pocta, than need at present be attempted.
But for satisfaction generally on this head, the reader is
referred to Gaisford's Hephaestion, 1810, to Hermann's
Elementa Doctriuae Metricae, 1816, and to Charles Bur·
ncy's article in the Monthly Remea, a. a, who was the first
scholar to investigate the subject, in 1798.

ln the Sapphie Stanza, the Greek preference so deeided
of a slaort syllable in the eth place where Horace always lras
the lonq, as well as numerous varicties of structure, which the
Romame fidicen lyam could not or would not adopt, have
been sufficiently described elsewherc*, and are too well
known to require formality of demonstration. Catullus's
Sapphie verse also, iu these pagos already referred to, may
easily be consultae, (Odes x1‚xnv111‚) to contrast his looser
and ruder movement with the regulated eadenccs of Horace,
in that its state of perfection as a Latin metro.
