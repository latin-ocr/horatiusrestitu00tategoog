The impression on his mind avos altogether deep and
ansul. Accordingly, in that affectionatc address to his pa-
tron, Cur me querelis, &c (2 C.-xv11), with Maecenas's

Finally, in an ode of invitation to Maecenas, (vorthy to be
classed vith those other tvo, 1 C. xx. Vile potabis, &c.‚
and 3 C. xxrx. Tyrrhena repam, &c.,) vc find the Poet,
in pursuance of a solemnvov to Bacchus, (2 E. 11. 78. Rite
cliens Bacchi somno gaudentis et umbra.,) celebrating on the
Calends of March the anniversery oi his deliverance.

It may be a more difficolt attempt to assign the probable
year, in which thc elder Horace, dissatisfied with the country
school of Flavius, determined to remove vith his son to
Rome, for the benefit oi the highest instruction which could
there be obtained. That son, on the retrospect of this in-
teresting period, vhen he asserta his own exemption as vell
from lov profligacy as from the sordes of avarice; gives
this account of whatever vas innocent or amiable in the
whole of his character.
