l‘.S. An earnest auxiety to lcarn whatever yet may bc
accurately known about the Fons Bandusinos,maintained to
bc the old genuine and only fountain ol that name, near
to Venusia (or Venoaa), induced me to consult Dr. Georgo
Errington‚ Pro-Rectus of tbe English college at Rome.
Accordingly I requested from him the ¹advantage ol' any re-
searcb which his command oftbe librarios there might give,
into the subject proposed; he was particularly desired ιο
examine every document which he could find, bearing on the
question in the Athe Chaupy's Dccoaoerte de la Μοίοοιι de
Compapnc d’Horoce, Vol. ιιι. pp. 364. 538, &c

In a long, euricus, entertainiug Letter lately received, my
learned and accomplished correspondent assures me, that
while the extract itself from the Bull of Pascal the nd (about
which I inquired) is indeed literolly correct, he considersits
application, however, as very suspiciosam· from the manner
in which Chaupy “ sees a little, presumes ogreat dcal, and
so jumps ιο the conclusion.”

The passage quoted by Chaupy and more fully given by
Μι. Hobbouse (vide the close of the Dissertation for parti-
culare) contains, to be sure, various words-de Castello

Brundusii-in Bandusiae fonte apud Venusiam, διο, which ·

seem full of excellent promise: but when rigidly examined‚
those words leave nothing essential, beyond the simple sact,
that in the year sn. 1103, “ at or near Venosa there was a
Chureb called in· Fonte Bandusiae, sor what cause so called
cannot now be ascertaincd.'' .

The fountain itsclf, somcwberc iu that neighbourhood bc-
youd a doubt, existed apparently in Horace's day. But
while the precise spot of the Poet’s birth, on the baulrs of the
Aufidus, and therefore if geography may bc trusted, not tm-
meds'ately near ιο Verlucio, bas but little chance now of
ever being exactly determined, the original Fons Bonaluaiaus
must without asigb bc resigncdtoits fate; perhaps tlratof an
extiuct fountain in a countrymorc or less subject ιο volcanic
