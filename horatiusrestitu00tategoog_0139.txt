oi' many topics variously calculated to illustrate the merite
of tho one and the gratitudo of the other.

Singularly enough, the first mention in point of time
perhaps, which the pen of Horace has left of Maecenas, and
certainly the very last introduction of his name, (to say
nothing of 2 C. xvrr. Cur me querelis and of all the
intermediste demonstrations,) bear striking testimony to the
early and late affection, which united the Patron to the
Post ou terms of the most familiar attachment.

to display the perverseness with which an uncandid con-
struction of character is too osten indulged; aud he exem-
pliiiesinhisowncase the offense which persona, less genereus
and less judicious than Maecenas, would have taken nt such
freedom as the Statesmsn when interrupted bore with perfect

good humour.

Alter the continuasse for five and twenty years of a
friendship begua in such a spirit, and at s period of his
writings (P. D.) when new topice for direct address could
hardly be expected, Horace thus beautifully and not the
lesa so for the oblique way of introducing it, in the Ode to
Phyllis, marks the celebratior of Maecenas's birthdny.
