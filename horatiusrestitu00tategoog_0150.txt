We may now return to Augustas so entitled; lirst how-
ever promising, that a title lilte that, of sacred majesty, was
not lilrely at the first to be given as his designation in
common. Accordingly, ewen in the second book of Odes it
occurs once only, (2 C. rx. 19, 20.) and that in conjunctiou
with the name Caesar: in the third book, only once alone
(3 C. r. 3.) and that in a very peculiar context. But in pro-
gress of years, as might bc expected, the Epistles and the
fourth book oi’ Odes show it to have theu become familiar
enough to stand alone asa personal appellatiop in the lau-

correction ο( agslight error and oversight in Bentley, (De
Temporibus,§ 6,) while it is impossible not to acknowledge
some confirmation thus ufforded to his general theory.

It can hardly be necessary here to remark, that several
of the Poet's allusive menningo, clear enough at the time,
especially those on matters of state, bave from the studious
delicacy of his language since vanished into tlrin air. The
famous Ode, l C. xiv. 0 navia, reserent adduced ογ
Quintilian as a good example of allegory, bas found an in-
genious solution (the only one at all consistent with our
chronology or with probability otherwise) in this happy con-
jecture of Sanadon; that it owed its birth to that critical
reason (n. c. 29.) when Caesar held deliberation with
Agrippa and Maecenas, whether to retain or resign the
sowereignty, whether to hazard or not the safety of the com-
mouwealth ογ restoring the republic.

Horace, we may well believe, was determined by bis
honest feelings on the side of tranquillity after such a series
of storms. And his own words,
