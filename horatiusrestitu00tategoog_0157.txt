gentlemen and men of letters, such as AElius Lamia, Aris.
tius Fuscus, Julius Florus, Pompeius Varus, Quintilius,
Numicius, &c Several of the last description, especially
if they occur as repestedly addressed or more than once
mentioned, msy now commodiously, in the writings of
Horace chronologicslly arranged, be viewed according to
the natural order in which the circumstances personally
concerning them are presented to the eye of the resder.
Under this head something has been already done in the
Preface, for the nomes of Grosphus, Iccius, Quintius Hir-

pinus, and Septimius: nor could the literary friends of Ho-
race (P. D. 59, 60) as such be overloolred. Very much, after
all, must still be lest to the taste ol esch individual resder,
and to the inclinetion which he feels for matters of such pecu·
liar research. One question of this kind relating to Septimius
may not unaptly be discussed here. 1f on the authority of
the Comtnentotor Vetus, as exhibited by Cruquius, we sre to
consider Titius (l Ε. ιιι. 9.) and Septimius, (rx. 1.) as
names of the seme person; then it seems to follow, that the
Epistles 111, vm, end rx, do not now stand in the same order
of time in which they were originally written, thetis, the
1xth, which recommends Septimius to the favour of Tiberius
Claudius Nero, must have preceded the 111d, in which
Titius is spoken of as aheady in the suite of that young
Prince: and not improbably it wss by the hands of Sep-
timius when he carried that introduction, that the v111th
Epistle also was conweyed to Celsus Albinovanus, then one
of the party. Talem in this succession, these three Epistles
msy perhaps be better understood snd more agreeably

pemsed.

On Agrippa, however, aud Sallustius the younger, and
Nasidienus Rufus and the Piros, some short remarlrs may
clearly be permitted from the relation which they bear to
Horace in one aspect or another.
