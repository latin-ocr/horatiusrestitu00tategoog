structure·

If, however, in the versification of modern scholars we
have to condemn unlicensed deviatione from the models of
Horace, we shall find in the formal practice of those early
Poeta who came after him, something more remarkable in
the opposite directior.

In Statius, for example, and in Prudentius, wc remark a
decided predilection for the structure (Α) so denoted here,
with the cadenee of secent on the 6th syllable, or of that
required on the dth and the 8th.

The Sapphics of Statius, tsitv. vrr, from his affection
for the oue caesura after the 5tb syllable and its concomi-
tant accentuation, have a very monotonous sound to the ear
aher the rich varieties of Horacc; while Prudentius at so
much later a period exhibita the same preference for un· ¹
varied harmony, giving indeed a much stronger proof of it
in one Sapphic Poem of 200 lines without a single deviation
from the structure alluded to. That Hymn, in honour of
the eighteen Martyrs, presente, on the other hand, the two
following examples ε

6th syllable accented3 unless polysyllabis words of that
dimension (which seems not improbable) had then getan
secent ou their lst syllable as well as on their 5th.

An ohservation arises here, so important if connected
with the chronology of Horace's books as originally pub-
lished, that the render will hardly fail to take some interest
in the detail which follows.
