the early date of a. c. 36, and then placor the satire,
25. vt. Hoc crat t'n ootia . . . along with the fact of Horace
getting that property, in the subaoquent year a. c. 31.
Whereas in the year a. c.36. aa we calculum, Horace was

Such ia our account of the mutter: auch is that of Dr.
Kirchner.

but only towholc books at a titur. Here distinction is

No onc denies, nor did Bentley mean to deny, that Horace
muat have allowed several ol' his writinga to be known
amongot hia friends at the time, either by private recitation‚
or by giving copiea of some pieoea, juat aa they were written.
From hence a partial publicity would be acquired; aa
unqueationably was the case with two of hia Satires, frum the
mention of Rufillus, l S. 11. 27. compared with rv. 92. and
of Lucilius l S. 1v. 8, 9. compared with 1 S. x. l. 'rhe
collective publication of the pieres afterwards in separate
bools is all that we coutend for.

And aa to the third head of objection, that Bentley is
wrong in aasenting Horace to have published the books
separately one by one, and not more than one hook at a time:
a sufficient answer on that head has been virtually given, in
cousideriog the principal point of it, whether the first,
second, aud third books of Odea could be, as Kirchner
