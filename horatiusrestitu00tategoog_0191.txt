(164) ou rus nunnus os noanon.

The words of the Romans then were accented by an iu-
variable rulc (and do we not now follow asimilar rule iu
reading Latin ?) namely, that if the penult be long, it shall
be aceentcd, as omilium· if it be short, the antepenult
shall be accentui, whether long or short, as amdoerom,
posteram.

All monosyllablcs were aecented; and in these pagos, if
not so marked, may be always so rechoned. Only, enclitics
lilre qvae, ve, ne, must be talen as forming part of the pre·
ceding word. Thus,

Ep. ιι. 45. Cloudc‘nsproe textis. . ..

Now for the application. The lambio trimeter in its
legitimate construction, whatever other acceut it has, takes
a leading one ou the sixth place: or 11 not so, then it
ruually requires to be accented on the fourth and the eighth.
Thus,

Ep. 1. 3. Paratus omne Cae'sarls periculum..

—- 7. Utrumne jussi persequemur otium.

The leading aceent on the sixth, though generally with
penthemimeral cassura, and at the beginning ο1 a word as

in Cae‘saris above, may yet be otherwise circumstanced, as,
Ep. ι. lb. Rogas, tuum labore quid juvem meo,

and Ep. ιι. 19. Ut gaudet insitiva decerpens pyra

Nay, more:
Ep· 1· io. Ut assidens implumibus pullis avis,

is au Iambic verse, because the sixth is aecented: whereas
· Ut assidens pullis ivis deplumibus,
though exactly the same as to quantities, would not be a
verse, on account of the wrong position of the accents.
A similar remark may be made on
Ep. xr. ls. Quodsi meis ina‘stuat precordiis,
as having neither caesura3 and yet it is an lambio verse

from the correctness of its leading accunt.
