On the authority ol Mr. Hobhouse (in his note 71 to Canto
1v. of Childe Harold) and from his own lively report we
leam, that the Pina is now as it vas in the days of
Virgil, agarden tree [pinus in hortis.Buc.v11. 65.]; and

that there is not” at present, “a Pine in the whole valley”
of Licenaa. 1 venture to add, that not one verse of Horace
decisively records a single Pine in that valley; and it is
barely possible, that in the course of the few years which
elapsed betwixt the td book of Satires and the ud or 3d
book of 0des, any Pine tree of Horace's own planting there
should have been itnmincns oilla (3 C. xxrr. 5.) or as in
the Ode before us, lile Virgil's plone trec, (Geo. rv. 146.)

Aa for Quinctius Hirpinus in particular, it is quite clear,
that he had nevcr visited (what friend ol Horace, does it

Poet's description of his deliniat (hae latebrae dulces) in the
Sabine valley, and of the romantio beauty (amoenae) which
adorned it. He did not rest bis attachment to that seques-
tered spot, on the ground of apartiality merely resulting
from babitual residente, “ curn locis etiam ipsis montuosis
delectemur et sylvestribus, (these arc Cicero's words,) in
quibus diutius commorati sumus.'' Laelius. s. 19. For
such scenery of the picturasque kind hc avows at once his
taste and admiration, ina way that we should hardly expect,
writing thus to his vauterannus. 19, 20. on the con-
