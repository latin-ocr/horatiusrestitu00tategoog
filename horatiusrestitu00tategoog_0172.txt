alleges, promiscuously written and then published together
all at once.

Nor is an immediate answer wanting to meet that one
allegation (at least) under the fourth head, that Bentley is'
wrong inallowing to Horace (as he appears to do) interwals
of idleness betwixt one set of books and another. As to that
subject of mere oversight or omission ou the part of Bentley,
satisfactory explanation has been already alforded in P. D.
p. 82.

The most ingenious and plausible perhaps of all Kirch-
ner'a conjectures is that which he has started under his
Qussrro (rr‘⁸) p. 54. De Itinera Brundusium Horace,

have addressed that Ode to the Fons Bandusinus, 3 C. x111.;
and having at the same time renewed his friendship with the
worthy old man Ofellus, he might on his return home have
composed the beautiful Satire, 2 S, 11. Quae cirum .....
And besides all this, for some reason or other, he might in
that year have written the Epode xr. Petu, nihil me . . . . 3
and the dialogue with Archytas too, l C. xxvru. Tamaris
et terrra . . . .-“ why so?'' if you aslr: Tarentum (v. 29) is
certainly mentioned in it.

In this complex scheme, built on a serica of assumptione,
even that part which regards the visit to Ofellus, though it
carries an air of probability with it, is by no means wanted to

account for Horace's actual acquaintance with those facts:
