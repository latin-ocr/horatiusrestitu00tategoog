to render them irretrievahly obscum (li this truth, aa
Gesner in his Praefatio remarks, ne have a curione example
in Brossett's Commentary on the Satires of Boileau; which,
though drawn up in the 'lifetime of that writer, required the
aid oi the Satirist himself for the completiou of the trah.

whatever non exista sor illustration of Horace from
sources οι· that traditional kind, may he found in the Indices
Nominum like that of Zeunius, or in the'Ortornosla'con of
the younger Ernesti. An article from the German of
Buttmann, οη the Historieol References ond Alluat'ons ira
Horace, is given in the philologiool Maneant, No. ιιι. pp.
sao-4843 to which the render may be referred for a great
deal ot cunnus and acute disquisition. The Greek names
Lalage, Glycera, dvc.,oecurringinHorace's 0des, he regards
ason the vhoie fictitious, p. tam and cuts off all necessity
to trace the story oi each person, beyond vhat each Ode sepa-
rately contains ior elucidating itself.

For such interpretation as the knowledge oi persons ad.
dressed or of political evenes alluded to must supply,
Buttmann's ingenious pages, though interesting vhenever
consulted, yet to my mind, on many points, are far from
carrying conviction: for instance, where, aa at page 483, in
regard ιο Sextus Pompeius and his party, he builds so much
on hypothetica! history, purely so; and particularly nhere he
represents Horace “in his enh or 28th year,'' aa having
“not yet formed any tie with the nev rulers of the State.”

As hearing on the main purpose of a norlr lite the
present, it is clear, that aster the attention paid to Maecenas
and Augustus, the principal persons in our drama, fen of
the manyother Personae Horatianos can require any long or
particular notice. Of those names, indeed, several belong
to the history ot* Rome, and can have little illustration here
but vhat is derived from that source; such as Agrippa, and
Pollio, and Sallustius Crispus, the elder Lollius, and the
young Nesos: others again are of the class oi Βοωιη
