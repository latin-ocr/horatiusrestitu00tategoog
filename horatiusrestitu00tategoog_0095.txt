ln passing to the Epodcc, very little appears for remark
to ruy purpose which is not already forestalled. We have
scen Horace carry the Poems of Archilochus nith him for
study and imitation into the Sabine valley. And as we
know the severe model of correctness in writing which hc
laid down for himself and enforced upon others, the conclu·
sion is fair, that he had taken most faithful psins with the
tasi, when he asterwards expresses such pride in the execu-

By' the bye‚ Horace has paid himselfa compliment here
which truth does not narrant. Canidia alone might testify,
that when in the Parian vein, Horace wanted neither talent
nor bitterness to drive a Lycamhes mad.

On the historical bearing of the book of Epodes, nothing
can be more satisfactory and singularly distinct than the
paragraph quoted in the Chrouological Table from Mr.
Clinton's Fasti Hellenici‚ under the year a. c. 31.

vu. Quo, qao scelesti. . .. contemplates the impending war
betwixt Ceasar and Antony as yet distant, and nith horror
and dismay deprecates such an event. The date of it, there-
fore, must be carried bach as far as other consideratione will
