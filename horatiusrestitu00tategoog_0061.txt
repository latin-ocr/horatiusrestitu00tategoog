(t.) Horace had a wey of his own, en oblique way of
mentioning sources of anxiety or objects of ambitione desire
in other men, froin which he considered himself fortunately
Thus in a passage of the lst Epode, to Moecenas, Ibis
Liburnia t'nier alta nntium, dc. in which he so tenderiy
begs as his companion to share the dangers of the ensuing
soar (called Action from its issue) i he declares his heart to
he inlinenced by honest affection alone, by no speculation of
splendid reward.

vr· ti-bb. Libenter boo somne militabitur

Bellum in tue spem gratiam

Non nt juvencis litigat· pluribus
Antra nitantur meis,

Pecusvs Celebris ante sidus fervidum
incana mutet puteat

Nec nt supsmi' vilis candens Tusculi
Circes tangat moenis.

It will hardly be believed, that instead of seeing in these
lines a disavowal of any wish for weaith and splendor,
some critice have found in the two last the sancied enlarge-
ment ofa magnificent villa at insecutum which Horace
already possessed there! ciam, voi. 11. pp. 262, 3.
trith great acuteness sets this mutter in its true light.
Let ns taire another instance.

’ Horace in amoody and weywsrd humour, real or affected,
1 Ε. vin. decoquentes, &c instructs the Muse thus ιο

enaret is Celsus Albinovanus should inquire about him:

-οίο, mults et pulchra minmtsm,
Vitare nec rocta nec suavitate haud qnia grando
contuderit vitos, sisoim momorderit estus,

Nee qnia impleatis simeonem segrotst in agrist
Sed quia ments mnus validus, bre. iso.
