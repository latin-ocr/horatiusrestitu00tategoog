‘⁶ The vicissitude which placedaPriett on the throne of the
Geram, hes ordaiued that a Bullof Pope Pascal the Second
should be the decisive document in ascertaining the site of
a fountain which inspired an Ode of Horace?

About so minute a concern long disquisitione here would
he tedious and nnnecessary. For in the first place, Mr.
Dnnlop’e solution (History of Roman Liternture. 1828.
Vol. ιιι. p. 213.) seems calculated to set the matter at rest
very easily.

“ The probability is, that Horace had named the clearest
and loveliest stream of his Sabine retreat, alter that iountain
which lay in Apulia, and on the brink of which he bad no
doubt often sported in infancy.”

And secondly, in confirmation ol Mr. Dunlop's conjec-
ture, 1 may be forgiven for inserting part of a Letter of my
own on this very point of difficulty, familiarly written in the
ycar1824.

“ Let the Fons Bandusie (now the Fonte Bello) of tho
Sabine vallcy, flou on with all its honours!

“For as to the Odcof Horace (3 C. aun), it tallies
admirably with the idea of his christoning what had no
name before, aster the romantio spring, which had a name,
not far from Venusia, and which he had lovcd when a
child.”

you may perhaps guther that this fountain had no namc
whatever, till Horace gave it one. The mons lovcr down
was certainly called Diqentim now Licenza.
