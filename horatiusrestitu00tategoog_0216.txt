admired vhat their predecessors hed done or emulated what
their contemporaries were doing.

quinquesyllabic beginning similar to that of the first and
second verses, aud so fer most injurious to variety,

lc.1x.11;xv1.7. Deproeliantea...· Non Liberaeque.

if the modes of ending it just mentioned are proscribed,
there remains for that purpose only one combination, iu a
monosyllabic preceding a trisyllabic nord,

Dsproelianter Ι neo cupressi. .

Non Liber aequc, Ι non emta..

But this formos the verse, though made up of ready ma·
terials, (aa all later practice shown) has been aparingly em·
ployed by Horace, only some forty times iu all: and vhe·
ther from dislike of the structure itself or from growing pre-
ference for others of a nobler kind, he has admitted verses
so constructed‚ at the rate only of half as often in the tvo
latter as in thc tvo former books of Odes. ls there nothing
supplied by this internal evidence also, in favour of our
general argument?

And here a curions and delicate remark, and one vhich
seems to have escaped ohservation, remains to be brought
fornard.

Horace theu never once has engaged the monosyllabic
nord in that close union end so far completed sense nith the .
word subjoined to it, vhich this verse from' Buchanan ex-
