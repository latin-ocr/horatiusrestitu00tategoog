authority, to illustrato, in some of thc nrost striking in-
stances, the connection existing betwixt the places of acceut
in Horatian metro, and the legitimare structure of the verse.
Fora complete aud satisfactory view of the subject in all
its bearings, the reader must be referred to the pagos of the
original article.

Before procceding to the task itsclsde Mean Horatianis,
it may bc prudent if not necessary to define the end pro-
posed in that labour. ln all the rnetrcs 1 shall hope to
malie tlic structure of the verse as well as the scansion un·
derstood; while in the most important os them, especially
those much in use sor exercises of imitativa composition, l
shall indulge greater latitudo of practical detail. Agreeably
to that view and purpose, tlrc nineteen denominations in Ho-
race will be treated os thus. Those in the Epodes, (num-
bered 1. to v11.,) which in the just ordcr of publication now
stand first, may in general be dispatched with less of cere-
monious regard; and those in the Odes,(v111. to xrr.,)
hardly lyrical measures, either from difficult construction
abandoned alter one or two experiments‚ or from whatever
cause not much favoured by Horace, will occupy abriefer
notice, but still with sufficient correctness. Thus, alarger
consideration may be fairly granted to verses of that spe-
cies (x111. to nvn.) which has its character from the Chori-
ambus interposed: and a still more extensive space will
thus bc allowed to the two principal metros (xvrrr. aud
xix.) in thc Sapphic and thc Alcaic stanza.
