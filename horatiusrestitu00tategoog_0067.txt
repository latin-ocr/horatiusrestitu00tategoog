“ In sooth,” almost from his cradle, young Horace “ was
no vulgar boy;” if we may credit his own story, with the
interpretation of it by the neighbours attached to circum-
stances of so surprising and delightful a nature.

In the spring therefore, a. c. 60. (in the spring, for it was
nont fronde) when Horace was a few months beyond bis
fourth year complete, that danger and deliverance befel him
in his adventurous wandorings, which no pen should de·
scribe but bis own.

30. tw. 9-20. hle fabulosae Volture in Appulo,
Altricis extra limen Apulis,
liudo fatigatumque somno,

Fronde novi puerum palumbe·
Texem: mirum quod foret omnibus,
Quicumque celsae nidum Acherousias,

Saltusque Bantinos, et arvum
⁴ Pingue tenent humilis ferentis
Ut tuto ab atris corpore viperis
Dor-mirem et ursin nt premerer sacri
Lausoque, collatique myrto,
Non sine nn animosus infans.

How beautifully aller this follows, how triumphantly
indeed!

Vester, Oanroenae, vester in arduos
Tollor sitnon &c &c

An accident, which ata much later period of life befel him
in apro Sabino, moy yet without impropriety be noticed
here; inasmuch as bo gratefully attributes bis protection
from that danger also to the favour of divine agency· T be
event alluded to produced at the time an ode, itself no mean
specimen of the triumph of poetry, (2 C. xm.) if we trace
tbe progress of fine reflection and splendid imagery from its

opening,
: Ille et nosnatotoposuit die,

to its close Ἰ

Nec curat Orion leones.
Aut timidos agitare lyncas
