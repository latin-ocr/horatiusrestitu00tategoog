not long aster, he was possessed of a aus and villula in the
Sabine valley: and charmed with the scenery of Tibur,
which on his way from Rome into the Sabine country he
often halted to admire, he finally became master of a cottoqe
with aycrm ιο it in the precincts of Tibur or as it is now
called Tiooli.

It was on this latter spot, if I may be allowed to antici-
pate‚ that he dedicated the plne-trec ιο Diana, (3C.xx11.
Montium custos..) in an ode remarkable also for its conti-
guity in position to that beautiful ode ιο Phidyle, Coelo au·

to the very same locality. May we not also with some
probability suppose, that of the two passages in which a

And here at setting out, let me avow that l feel no scruple
in imputing the rrusr great source of confusion and error
ιο that unluchy expression in the Life attributed ιο Sueto·

hrtrlini: domusque ejus ostenditur circa 'fihumi luculum.''
And the phrase itself, Sabini cot Tiburtini, had its origin,
there can be no doubt, in the Iambic Scaaona of Catullus
Au Fundam. xo.

Ο Funde noster, seu Sabine, scu Tiburs,

Nam tc esse Tiburtem sutumant, quibus non est
Cordi Catullum ludam at quibus cordi ast,
Quovis Sabinum pignore aare contendunt.

The author, whoever he was,'of that Life, apparently quite
ignorant of the Sabine valley, never seems to have sup-
posed, that Horace had any rural residente except at 'l'ivoli,
