What is the remark of Baxter on this passage?

“ 15. Bene labentis equo: nam Parthorum pugna fere
crat equestris. Apposuit autem ista, quo gratificaretur
Augusto, ob recepta signa Marco Crasso adempta.”

Anachroniam and confusion like this might be expected
from Baxter. One may wonder that the cautious and
accurate Gesner should interpose no correction of it. But ’
neither is he found always faithful to his qualified declaration
of agreement with Bentley.

Hoc certe confirmare possum, me, dum recenseo singulas
Eelogaa, diligenter attendisse, si quid esset Bentleianis tem·
porum rationibus adversum, nec deprehendisse quidquam,
quod momentum aliquod ad eam evertendam haberet; licet
quibusdam Eelogis uon improbabili ratione forte tempus
etiam aliud, recentius prasertim, possit adscribi.

The clearness of view which arises from placing the
Satires before the Epodes, and the Epodes before the Odes,
cannot be denied. 'l'he advantage to be derived from
Bentley's arrangement in placing the ath boolr of Odes after
the lat boolr of Epistles, may not perhaps be quite so
evident. One example or two will serve to show the im·
portanoe of that distribution.

There is an intellectual as wellas a linear perspectiva⁴
And some space for time and thought must be allowed
to intervene: or in the ease of great moral and political
changes talriug place, without tbe aid of that interval,
very osten all the probabilities of expectation will be
shoclred. Thus, if seven or eight years are considered to
elapae betwixt the average date of the 3d boolr of Odea
and the publication of the 4th3 even in the omens of
moral improvement displayed in the latter we shall see
nothing extravagant‚ in those of politica! alteration we shall
aee the highest credibility.
