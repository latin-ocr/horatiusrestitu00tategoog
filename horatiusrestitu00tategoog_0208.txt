ow rna narnus or nornen. (181)

Videt, ut elta Ι stet nive mumdum
Soracte, nee jam 1 sustineant onus
Silva laborantes, geluque
Flumina constiterint acuto?

The first and second lincs have their cranam thus.

The third thus alwayS,

The fourth thus,

l. ln the first and second linea, through the first and
second books, a marked preference of the Spondaic begin·
ing to the lambic is quite obvious. this becomes more
striking still through the third book: and the fourth book

’ has not one instance, ewen with a polysyllabic word asin
tbe third, much less with a dissyllabic word initial, of an
Iambus thus placed:

l C. xxxr· 17. Frui 1 paretis, et valido mibi . ..
³0. ι. 2. stote 1 linguis: <armins non print . ..

—- 26. Tumultuosum . ..

In addition to the fact already adduced, P. D. p. 13, of
the more severe model of structure in the third line intro-
duced by Horace into the latter books of his Odcs, wc have
here shown thatin other points also a fine sensibility of ear
led him to yet niccr improvements as congenial to the Latin
tongues which in imitative composition must now be re-
garded, if any respect is due to the authority of Horace.

2. The following cases of eliciort may deservo a brief
notice.

Of elisione after the caesura like the following,

l C. xxxiv. la Mutare, et insignem Ι attenuat Deus
30. 1. 5. Regum timendorum Ι in proprios gregat.
thcre are not quite twenty in all.
