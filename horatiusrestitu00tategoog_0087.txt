The comio author Fundanius we meet again, (2 S. v111. 19,)
aethe pleasant narrator of what happened at Nasidienus's
diuner. Varius, whose fine tragedy of Thyestes is so highly
praised by Quintilian, appears already to have been eele-
brated for that epic talent alluded to in l C. vu,

sniberia Vario tortis et hostium
Viator, Mreonio earminls aliti3 &o

and Pollio had acquired eminence in the tragic durna,
which we find him still maintaining when afterwards engaged
in the history ol* the civil wara;

while in regard to Virgil the clear information is gained,
that he was then only known as the writer of Bucolica, but
in the delicacy and high finish of his style, (molle utque
jaceam) ewen then indicating the consummate poet that

was soon to ariae.
And here from the saure satire not unaptly may be intro-

duced the proud list of oll Horaee's friends at that early
day.

Well then might Horace, when allowing in other resyaects
