ΟΝ HORACE’S osmonrlorvs ΤΟ THE oanni< l’O‘E'l'S.

*-

Ir has been already stated (P. D. 70) that Horace aelmon-
ledged and justified his borrovving the metros ol' Archilochus
and of Alcaeus, with such adaptation aa the genius os the
Latin language required.

The point of his more substantial obligations to the
Greek Poeta in subject, imagery‚ and sentiment, may be
studied with advantage in awork of curious literature quoted
belov*. Ι am inclined to thinlr, however, that the amount
of what he oves on that score (and avovvedly incurred, for
such imitation vas an honorable taslr) has been greatly
overrated. And itan estimare in other cases may be taken

on the average from that fragment of Alcaeus (even allowing
the ingenious emendation of χθόνα.. . παίειν for τινα...
πίνειν). . .

Νῦν χρὴ μεθύσκειν καὶ χθόνα πρὸς βίαν
Παίειν, ἐπειδὴ κάτθανε Μύρσιλος.

the sum total then of the debt will provo no great deduc·
tion from tho solidity of his fame.

At the most, Alcaeus supplies only the catchvord of the·
Ode, l C. xxxvrr.

Nune eat bibendum, nuuc pede libero
Pulsanda tellus:
