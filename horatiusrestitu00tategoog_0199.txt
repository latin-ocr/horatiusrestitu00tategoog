(172) ou rue aternus or nouare.

The latter example perhaps moy be defended or excused
on the same ground with the Alcaic verse,

l C. xxxvrr. t. Antehac nolas del promere Comitum..

Marna xv. l C. 111. (1) Glyconic so called. (2) As-
clepiad as in Metre xiv.

(l) sic ta diva potens Cypri
(2) siceranes Helena, lueida sidera,

The verse (1) has its sconmon thus, .

without any deviation: for the line] C. xv. 36. as sourc-
timcs edited, with -. initiat,

Ignis Iliacas domos..

should unqucstionably stand thus corrected:

lgnls Pergameas domoc

On tho authority of the worse reading, however, Casimirhas '
occasionally erred.
thyrie. ιιι. 47. JussitlreBorysthenem.

In this verse also the nicety of accentuation, which is ne-
cessary, deservcs to be remarlred. And the fictitious line,

veremudum,

though correct in scansion and quantity, is not, however, a
Latin verse, because it has not the right accentual cadence
observed in the Glyconic: it has that of averse generically
different, the Iamhic dimeter,

Ep. rr. ln. lmiltus rit flebo phar.

, One real line, faulty in that very way from thc peu of the
elegant Grotius, which closes hia Hymn of Zacharias para-
phrascd, may show, that Dr. Herbcrt's remark here recorded
does not guard against an imaginary error.
