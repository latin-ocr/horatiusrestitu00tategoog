high birth. From whence, it ruay be askod, did this ad·
juuct of nobility ond opuleucc arise, which so marked civil
society in the age of Augustus? Clearly enough, its origin
wns military, in the custom for young rnen of family to go

out ae wntubernulea to commandere in chief and ‚governors
oi provinces, and under their eye ιο leam all the uirtutes
imperatorios whether of pruvincial policyor of the art of
war.

The authority oi Cicero for the military practice in his ’
doy is very explicio 'l'alre ¹two instances as presented by
Ernesti in his walueble Index latinitatis. Pro Cn.
Plancio, 5 ll. and Pro M. Coelio, 5 30. it is stated as o¹
fact highly hononrable ιο their characters, that the one eu·
joyed the contubernii necessitudo with Aulus Torquatus,
and that lhc other went into Africo to be Q. Pompeio Pro·
consuli contubernalis. For a period not much later, the
words ol Horace may be considered sufficicntly clear, aa
when atl S. vu. 25. ho mentions the comites oi Brutus,
aud at l E. vnn 2. hc writes ιο Celsus Albinovanus, comiti
scribaeque Neronis, with the cohors also oi that young
princo (v. 14) alluded ιο. ln a brief sketch like this, oue
more example, but that of a splendid name, may suffice,
The young Agricola, as we erc told by Tacitus, ξ 5. Prirna
castrorum rudimenta Suetonio Paulliuo diligentiae moderato
duci approbavit, clectus, quem contubernio aestimaret.

Now, by what process the transition toolr place from tho
contubernalis of the Praetorium abroad to the cornea of the
mansion or the villa at horne, it may be a difficolt office to
develope. But the two Epistles,xv11.and xvru. to Scaeva
und to Lollius, (of which the latter supplies the term corni·
tem, v. 30. ἰο sequence to dices emices, v. 24. as the cor-
relativo, followed by potentis amini, v. 44. iu the samo
meaning) abundantly demonstrato, that the relation of
such a mittor to such n major amictos prcvailcd much in the
highest Roman society, οι thc time whcn Horace wrote
