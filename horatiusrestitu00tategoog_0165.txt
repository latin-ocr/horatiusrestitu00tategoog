grandson Caius, a. c. 1.; and of course long before any im·
putation whatever could have been caat on his public orbis
private integrity.

The vindication of Lollius from certain calumnies, for
which no pretence can be found before the period when as
the tutor of the young Princo he incurred the hatred of
Tiberius, Ι have with great care and perhaps not without
success undertahen in the Gentleman’s Megarios, May,
1u34, under the title of Vindicio Lolliano.

The two passages of Velleius Paterculus audone of the
Elder Pliny, on which alone those calumnies are founded,
arc in that article produced and subjected to severe examin-
ation. Of any fact or even hint in disparagement of
Lollius's character, neither in Tacitus nor in Suetonius,
does one lristorical vcstige appear; while of Velleius's base·
nese in flattering the bad passione of Tiberius, proofs and
testimonias are brought forward enough to satisfy any rea-
sonabledemand. ’

And I am strangely mistalsen is Horace himself, not '

withstanding the honours paid to the “Major Neronum''
(4 C. x1v. 14.) in his best days (egregius viat laniatque quoad
privatus vel in imperiis sub Augusto fuit. Ann. vr. 51.) did
not owe every marked suppression of bis name to that very
Ode in praise of Lollius which we are now considering. To
what cause, indeed, so probable as Tiberian malignitydeeply
operating, may the following fact be attributed?

In Velleius’s *catalogue of Roman Poeta, L. 11. c. 36,
§§9, 3, the names of Lucretius, Catullus, Virgil, Tibullus,
and Naso, are all prominently paraded :—that of Horace is
not visible!

Could this striking omission then be the result of mere
'oversight with such immense chauces in calculation against
it? or is it not naturally accounted for at once, by suppos-
ing it a sacrifice to the dark disgust of Tiberius's eye?
