quire some ingenuity to conjecture, how he could buy for
himself a patent place as clerlr in the 'l'reasury; which of
course must have been the lower way of getting admission
into that respectable office. Tbat such purchases were
made, and as early as n. c. 70, appears to be an unques-
tionable fact, from Cicero, Ira Verrem. L. 111. §b 78, 9,

and diligent Ernesti, in his Cluuia Ciceroniana, under the
