THE METRES

OF

HORACE.

Μαι-...ιιι-

In presenting to Scholars a neto l'reatise on the Messes oi
Horace, 1 annot but anticipate scandid reception 'for
what is so proposed. whatever has been hitherto done
sunder tlsat title, has aeldom exceeded a meagrc account land
that notin all points accurate) os the scansion merely, vltlr
little orno tagard to the verse in its structure. The very
lateat tract, 'bearing date laon-that which Doering has
given aa a communicatiou from hia friend Spart, deserves
generally the compliment paid by him of being very skil-
lnlly aad correctly executed. Yet oven that, though seldotn
taiutcd nith absolute error, is greatly deficient in some essen·
tial points, ns to Horace's earlier and later modes of con-
structing the mnne verse. This remark vill be strikingly
apparent in our account os the Alcaic Stanna3 occasionally
it vill be vcriiied in others also.

1f the question be asked on what grounds the present
treatiae may be entitled to highcr consideration aa more
nearly embrncing every desideratum vhich belongs to the
subject3 let it be said once ior all, that from various sources
of critical observatiam, in which my ovn professional study
for many years had its dne share, tite voris now published
hus been very diligently compoaed.
