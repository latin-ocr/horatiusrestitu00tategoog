what else do we read, but that those followers 01 Brutus,
young, ardent, and brave, did not realise on the field of
battle that high conlidence 01 success with which they ap-
proached it. At all events, the attribute 01 military proweoo,

elsewhere accorded to the victorious side, a's in Horace's
own words,

might surely be conceded by the wanquished party.

, But, in truth, for the natural result 01 that as 01 the other
grem engagements in the civil war, (Pharsalia, Philippi,
Actium) Tacitus, when he has occasion to allow the com·
meucement in the Eost to be so far inauspicious to Vespa·

conquerors in each conflict had the old soldiers of the Wect
on their side.

Hist. ιι. 6. Namque olim validissima interae civium mma,
in Italia Gallitae, viribus Occidentis coepta. Et Pompeio,
Cassio, Bruto, Antonio, quos omnes trans mare secutum est
civile bellum, haud prosperi exitus fuerant

Alter the battle 01 Philippi, so fatal to the republican
cause, when in the terse and pointed language 01 Tacitus,

armo,” and more especially when after some happy years,
in which, under Maecenas's wing, Horace had enjoyed at
Rome the literary leisure which he lowed; bis attachment
then to the cause 01 Caesar rather than to that 01 Antony,
on the quarrel between those competitore for empire bursting
out into war, cannot surely be wondered at, much less does
it require any excuse. Yet even then, though he has de-
voted an Ode to Cleopatra, a total silence regarding the
name of Antony in whatever be wrote, marks the delicacy
which he has observed on all subjecta 01 political dissension.
