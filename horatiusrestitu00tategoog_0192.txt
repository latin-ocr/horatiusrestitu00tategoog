others, the Romans may seem to have admitted a seeondary
accent on the first syllable: a supposition which would re-

store propriety to the following verse‚'
, Ep. ιι. l& Simul calentis {evenenandos deus.

lt remains to be noticed as a singular fact, that of verses
constructed lile

Ep. ι. 7. Utrumne jussi Ι persequemur Ι otium,

many examples occur in Terence as his Prologuca alone may
teatify‚ in the Epodea of Horace, and in the Fablcs of Phae-
drus; yet in the Tragcdiea which bear the name of Seneca,
not a single instance can be found of a verse constituted

lilre that above.

Iambic dimeter (2).
The scansion of this verse as to ita predominant and ad·
missible fect:

ln the dimeter the νν- initiat, though from the trimeter not
excluded‚ seems inadmissible. Casimir Sarbievius uses it,

Epod. ι. 18. Metuendae jaceret fulmina.

As to the atrectare, it is worthy of observation, that a
verse from ita composition accented like the following,

C. Sarb.E1a v. 2. Non nudus ensium timor,

though a just dimeter as to quantity, ia never found in Ho-
race, nor in any author of the early ages.

Now as the iambus itsclf is used freely in the third place,
this combination might have occurred very often, if it had
not been purposely avoided. ln what then does the faulti·
ness of that line consist? Clearly in this, that it bears the
accentual cadence peculiar to a very different kind of verse,
the Glyconic: of which verse,
