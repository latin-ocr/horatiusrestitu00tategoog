Horace himself denominatcd (Ep. xrv. 7. cf. 1 Ε. xrx.
23-25.) ·

lnosptos, olim promissum eumen, lambos,

should become ensmonred of his own inventione and creste
a chsos accordingly.

It is true indeed, that among his lyric odes, Horace has
not scrupled to insert some pieces in a metre not strictly
lyric: as, 1 C. rv, νη, vrrr, xxv1113 20. xv1113 30.
κη, euru. But then among the Epodes there is
nothing 'lyriool whatsoerer3 of itself, surely, s decisive
fact, tbat to the odes, a higher class of poetry, he did not
devote his mind at all till a later period.

And bere it may be observed, that the word carmen,
though specifically applied to lyr-ic odes, as ΞΕ. 11, 59.
Carmine tn gaudes: hic delectatur lambis-yet is appli-

v. 85, medio inter carmina, means that the mama was
interrupted. Let uo conclusion therefore be drawn from

the use of that word, independently of circumstances in* the
context to determine its character.

Hencesorth, of course, we find him mnch less resident at
Rome3 and when occasionelly there, annoyed with matters
of business, innisa negotio, 1 Ε. xrv. 17, and, aliena,
2 S. vr, 33, ou the Esquiline, to a much greater degree than
before3 or at any rate he liles so to represent it.

All that new dclight ol his in the rus and oillnlo among
tbc Sabines, iu the sconery which adorned bis estate, and in
the sbrerrd and virtuons peoplc into whose society it threw
him, Horace exquisitcly describes in thc vrth Satirc of the
