thot even in that darlr state of all true theology, Horace
had the grateful feeling of religion, however obscurely aa to
the objecta of it, aud that hevae right in the suffectione
gratitude, though he was wrong in the ob‘ective devotion?

The connection, from causes curioud and rare, of Mae- ,

cenas'a name with the town of Tivoli, has ' been auspicious
to the developement ol Horace'a principnl locality in that
romantio spot. For not only has that admirable Ode,
3 C. xxix. Tyrrheno regum.. ..afforded subject almost for
demonstration, that Horace invited Maecenas to dine at
Tivoli: but that beautiful and from its allusion, pathetic
Ode, l C. xx. Vile potatis, dc. according to an old tradi-
tion recorded by the commentator in Cruquius, and credited
by Torrentius, was occasioned by a journcy of Maecenas into
Apulia.

Maecenas iturus in Apuliam, significavit Horatio, ei se
ante profectionem convivam esse velle: cui respondet Hora-
tius, sequidem non hahere vinum generosum, aed benigno
tamem animo ei exhibiturum vinum quod habebat Sabinum.
De profectione in Apuliam mentio fit in Divaei codice.

that the prime minister would aslr Horace to give him a
dinner at Rome before he set out? Is it not far more
natural to conceive, that Maecenas had told his friend to
expect him at Tivoli to dinner, as he would paas by the
Vin Valerio, (Cramer. 1. 142. rr. 260,) and that Horace on
such a hint, really having a caslr ol Sabine vine there with
ao delightful a remembrance attached to it,

--- datur in therua Ι cum tibi plausus, &a

wrote in reply the delicate and well turned invitation in that
Sapphic Ode?
