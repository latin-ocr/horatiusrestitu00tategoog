'ow awa saxa oa rara norrrow. (151)

Praecipusm carm duxit sensum- animi pram apertissima
exprimere: quod quo facilius efficeret, aut newbi lectorem
vel auditorem obturbaret ac moraretur, neque praepositiones
verbis rddere neque conjunctimacs saepius iterare dubitavit, ·
quae detractae afferrmt aliquid obscuritatis, etsi gratiam
augent. ·

The parenthelic mark also, when critically interposed‚
may serve well to prevent confusion and mistakc. Tha
follow'nrg passage, awkward at the best, affords good illus-
tration of such a use; ⁵

rs xv. oo-ro ut aa ru amna cau namqusuoonum,

Nou ago sim Capri nsque Sulci3 (cur metuar mal)

Nulla taberna meos habeat nequa pila llbcllor,

Qucis manus insudet vulgi Hermogenisque Tigelli,

Nec recitem quidquam, uisi amicis, idque coactm

Non ubivis, mre quibuslibet.
Where unless the words . . cur metuas me? . ‚be kept se·
parate by a parenthesis, the continuity of· the sense is en·
tirely lost. A rough translation will show it sufficiantly.

'Ihough you may resemble those highwaymeu, Coelius
aad Birrius, it does not follow that 1 am to bc like Caprius
or Sulcius, the informers, (why need you then be afraid of
mei) nor that any slaop should have my writiugs for sale, nor
yet thatI should malta a common practice of rehearsing,
dyc, irc.

Here, be it remarked, the old commentator iu Cruquius
seems to have rightly apprehended the difficulty of the
passage, as it usually stands; which hc would rectify by ’
supplying cum before v. 71. [Cum] nulla taberna, dac.
With cram, sure enough, cvcry thing would run on per.
spicuously and well: but then cum is not there, audit
cannot ou any pretence be understood..

Nor is the marl here occasionally sct on the a final with·
out its advantage, to show the true reading, especially aliare
a change in the text lras taken place, as l Sat. rx. 29, 30.

Sabella Ι Quod puero occinit motai divina anua arnt.
